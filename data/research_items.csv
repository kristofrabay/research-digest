However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20612v1,Making Large Language Models Efficient Dense Retrievers,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Recent work has shown that directly fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for dense retrieval yields strong performance, but their substantial parameter counts make them computationally inefficient. While prior studies have revealed significant layer redundancy in LLMs for generative tasks, it remains unclear whether similar redundancy exists when these models are adapted for retrieval tasks, which require encoding entire sequences into fixed representations rather than generating tokens iteratively. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of layer redundancy in LLM-based dense retrievers. We find that, in contrast to generative settings, MLP layers are substantially more prunable, while attention layers remain critical for semantic aggregation. Building on this insight, we propose EffiR, a framework for developing efficient retrievers that performs large-scale MLP compression through a coarse-to-fine strategy (coarse-grained depth reduction followed by fine-grained width reduction), combined with retrieval-specific fine-tuning. Across diverse BEIR datasets and LLM backbones, EffiR achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference cost while preserving the performance of full-size models.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20610v1,FedPOD: the deployable units of training for federated learning,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.",2025-12-25

Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20605v1,Emergent temporal abstractions in autoregressive models enable hierarchical reinforcement learning,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term ""internal RL"", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.",2025-12-25

Existing diffusion based text generation models, such as DiffuSeq, suffer from high computational cost and memory overhead when applied to extended sequences. To address these challenges, MoE-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts architecture, enabling efficient and scalable long sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoE-DiffuSeq significantly improves training efficiency and sampling speed compared to existing diffusion models. These advantages are particularly effective for long document scenarios, including scientific article generation, code repository modeling, and long form dialogue generation. Benchmark results further show that MoE-DiffuSeq improves efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness, advancing the practical applicability of diffusion models for high quality long form text generation.",2025-12-25

The critical insight is using the port concept to pair the flow of goods (the electrical current) with the agent's incentive (the voltage) in an economic interaction. By building networks of agents interacting through ports, we create models with multiple levels of abstraction, from the macro level down to the micro level. We are thereby able to model complex macroeconomic systems whose dynamical behavior is emergent from the micro level. Using the LTSpice circuit simulator, we then design and analyze a series of example systems that range in complexity from the textbook Robinson Crusoe economy to a model of an entire economy.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20595v1,Cube Bench: A Benchmark for Spatial Visual Reasoning in MLLMs,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20589v1,Leveraging High-Fidelity Digital Models and Reinforcement Learning for Mission Engineering: A Case Study of Aerial Firefighting Under Perfect Information,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.",2025-12-25

We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.",2025-12-25

The inclusion of Building Information Modeling (BIM) plays a central role in this shift, yet its influence on job satisfaction remains underexplored. In response, this study developed a human-centered measurement model for evaluating job satisfaction in BIM work environments by adapting Hackman and Oldham's Job Characteristics Model for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry to create a survey that captured industry perspectives on BIM use and job satisfaction. The model uses Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling to analyze the survey results and identify what dimensions of BIM-related work affect job satisfaction. While it was hypothesized that BIM use increases job satisfaction, the results show that only some dimensions of BIM use positively impact BIM job satisfaction; the use of BIM does not guarantee an increase in overall job satisfaction. Additionally, more frequent BIM use was not associated with higher satisfaction levels. These findings suggest that in the AEC industry, sustainable job satisfaction depends less on technological autonomy and more on human-centric factors, particularly collaboration and meaningful engagement within digital workflows.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20582v1,Relu and softplus neural nets as zero-sum turn-based games,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.",2025-12-25

Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.",2025-12-25

However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.",2025-12-25

While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.",2025-12-25

We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It ""fails fast"" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and ""wins big"" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.",2025-12-25

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Our main result is the significantly improved sample complexity for learning such low-degree polynomials. We show that, for any regression risk $\eps \in (0,1)$, a carefully designed two-layer NN with channel attention and finite width of $m \ge Θ({n^4 \log (2n/δ)}/{d^{2\ell_0}})$ trained by the vanilla gradient descent (GD) requires the lowest sample complexity of $n \asymp Θ(d^{\ell_0}/\eps)$ with probability $1-δ$ for every $δ\in (0,1)$, in contrast with the representative sample complexity $Θ\pth{d^{\ell_0} \max\set{\eps^{-2},\log d}}$, where $n$ is the training daata size. Moreover, such sample complexity is not improvable since the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the order $Θ(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$ with probability at least $1-δ$. On the other hand, the minimax optimal rate for the regression risk with a kernel of rank $Θ(d^{\ell_0})$ is $Θ(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$, so that the rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the network trained by GD is minimax optimal. The training of the two-layer NN with channel attention consists of two stages. In Stage 1, a provable learnable channel selection algorithm identifies the ground-truth channel number $\ell_0$ from the initial $L \ge \ell_0$ channels in the first-layer activation, with high probability. This learnable selection is achieved by an efficient one-step GD update on both layers, enabling feature learning for low-degree polynomial targets. In Stage 2, the second layer is trained by standard GD using the activation function with the selected channels.",2025-12-25

Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery.",2025-12-25

However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly.

Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets.

The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature. We extend score-matching-based DRE methods to Riesz representer estimation. Our proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also provides insights for causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions.",2025-12-25

However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.",2025-12-25

We introduce a unified, ex ante statistical model that derives expected return, downside risk, and upside potential profit from the first principles of mining: Each hash is a Bernoulli trial with a Bitcoin block difficulty-based success probability. The model yields closed-form expected revenue per hash-rate unit, risk metrics in different scenarios, and upside-profit probabilities for different fleet sizes. Empirical calibration closely matches previously reported observations, yielding a unified, faithful quantification across hardware, pools, and operating conditions. This foundation enables more reliable analysis of mining impacts and behavior.",2025-12-25

This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this ""too big to fail"" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect.",2025-12-25

Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.",2025-12-25

In response, we introduce RISE (Recurrent Integration via Simplified Encodings), a novel approach that can leverage recurrent networks in any image-based off-policy RL setting without significant computational overheads via using both learnable and non-learnable encoder layers. When integrating RISE into leading non-recurrent off-policy RL algorithms, we observe a 35.6% human-normalized interquartile mean (IQM) performance improvement across the Atari benchmark.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20503v1,$L^2-$posterior contraction rates for Gaussian process and random series priors in Bayesian nonparametric regression models,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: The nonparametric regression model with normal errors has been extensively studied, both from the frequentist and Bayesian viewpoint. A central result in Bayesian nonparametrics is that under assumptions on the prior, the data-generating distribution (assuming a true frequentist model) and a semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ on the space of regression functions that satisfy the so called testing condition, the posterior contracts around the true distribution with respect to $ρ(.,.)$, and the rate of contraction can be estimated. In the regression setting, the semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ is often taken to be the Hellinger distance or the empirical $L^2$ norm (i.e., the $L^2$ norm with respect to the empirical distribution of the design) in the present regression context. However, extending contraction rates to the ``integrated"" $L^2$ norm usually requires more work, and has previously been done for instance under sufficient smoothness or boundedness assumptions, which may not necessarily hold. In this work we show that, for classes of priors based on random basis expansions or Gaussian processes with RKHS of Sobolev type and in the random design setting, such $L^2$ posterior contraction rates can be obtained under substantially weaker assumptions than those currently used in the literature. Importantly we do not require a known a priori upper bound on its supremum norm or that its smoothness is larger than $d/2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the covariates. Our proof crucially relies on an application of the matrix Bernstein concentration inequality to empirical inner product matrices, which require explicit upper bounds on the basis functions at hand that we prove in several cases of interest. In particular we obtain upper bounds on the supremum norm of Mercer eigenfunctions of several reproducing kernels (including several Matérn kernels) which are of independent interest.",2025-12-25

However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20485v1,WOC: Dual-Path Weighted Object Consensus Made Efficient,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Modern distributed systems face a critical challenge: existing consensus protocols optimize for either node heterogeneity or workload independence, but not both. For example, Cabinet leverages weighted quorums to handle node heterogeneity but serializes all operations through a global leader, limiting parallelism. EPaxos enables parallel execution for independent operations but treats all nodes uniformly, ignoring performance differences. To tackle this problem, we present WOC, a dual-path consensus protocol that dynamically routes operations into two paths based on their access patterns. Independent operations execute through a fast path that uses object-specific weighted quorums and completes in one network round-trip. Conflicting or shared objects route through a leader-coordinated slow path employing node-weighted consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates that WOC achieves up to 4X higher throughput than Cabinet for workloads with >70% independent objects, while maintaining equivalent performance under high contention.",2025-12-25

However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20481v1,Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.",2025-12-25

The analysis introduces a state-switching specification in which the market state is proxied by the slope of the yield curve, and proposes an Aligned Economic Index built from the popular predictors of Welch and Goyal (2008) (augmented with bond and equity premium measures). The Aligned Economic Index under the state-switching model exhibits statistically and economically meaningful in-sample ($R^2 = 5.9\%$) and out-of-sample ($R^2_{\text{oos}} = 4.12\%$) predictive power across both recessions and expansions, while outperforming a range of widely used predictors. In this work, I examine the added value for professional practitioners by computing the economic gains for a mean-variance investor and find substantial added benefit of using the new index under the state switching model across all market states. The Aligned Economic Index can thus be implemented on a consistent real-time basis. These findings are crucial for both academics and practitioners as expansions are much longer-lived than recessions. Finally, I extend the empirical exercises by incorporating data through September 2020 and document sizable gains from using the Aligned Economic Index, relative to more traditional approaches, during the COVID-19 market turbulence.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20469v1,Bohrium + SciMaster: Building the Infrastructure and Ecosystem for Agentic Science at Scale,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.

Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing.",2025-12-25

I contribute in two ways. First, I introduce a state-switching predictive regression in which the market state is defined in real time using the slope of the yield curve. Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by \textcite{WelchGoyal2008}, improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS).

However, existing frameworks largely rely on unstructured natural-language reasoning and accumulate raw intermediate traces in the context, which often leads to unstable reasoning trajectories, context overflow, and degraded performance on complex multi-hop queries. In this study, we introduce Laser, a general framework for stabilizing and scaling agentic search. Laser defines a symbolic action protocol that organizes agent behaviors into three spaces: planning, task-solving, and retrospection. Each action is specified with explicit semantics and a deterministic execution format, enabling structured and logical reasoning processes and reliable action parsing. This design makes intermediate decisions interpretable and traceable, enhancing explicit retrospection and fine-grained control over reasoning trajectories. In coordination with parsable actions, Laser further maintains a compact context register that stores only essential states of the reasoning process, allowing the agent to reason over long horizons without uncontrolled context expansion. Experiments on Qwen2.5/3-series models across challenging multi-hop QA datasets show that Laser consistently outperforms existing agentic search baselines under both prompting-only and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating that Laser provides a principled and effective foundation for robust, scalable agentic search.",2025-12-25

These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary. Moreover, we show that recall based strategies can be decided in PSPACE.

In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705.

Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) scans provide complementary information on acute and sub-acute ischemic changes; however, automated lesion delineation remains challenging due to variability in lesion appearance.
  In this work, we study ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using multimodal diffusion MRI from the ISLES 2022 dataset. Several state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including U-Net variants, Swin-UNet, and TransUNet, are benchmarked. Based on performance, a dual-encoder TransUNet architecture is proposed to learn modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC inputs. To incorporate spatial context, adjacent slice information is integrated using a three-slice input configuration.
  All models are trained under a unified framework and evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results show that transformer-based models outperform convolutional baselines, and the proposed dual-encoder TransUNet achieves the best performance, reaching a Dice score of 85.4% on the test set.

However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.",2025-12-25

While providing a reproducible toolkit to generate, intercept and analyze DoH exfiltration, and comparing Machine Learning vs threshold-based detection under adversarial scenarios. The originality of this project is the introduction of an end-to-end, containerized pipeline that generates configurable file exfiltration over DoH using several parameters (e.g., chunking, encoding, padding, resolver rotation). It allows for file reconstruction at the resolver side, while extracting flow-level features using a fork of DoHLyzer. The pipeline contains a prediction side, which allows the training of machine learning models based on public labelled datasets and then evaluates them side-by-side with threshold-based detection methods against malicious and evasive DNS-Over-HTTPS traffic. We train Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression classifiers on a public DoH dataset and benchmark them against evasive DoH exfiltration scenarios. The toolkit orchestrates traffic generation, file capture, feature extraction, model training and analysis. The toolkit is then encapsulated into several Docker containers for easy setup and full reproducibility regardless of the platform it is run on. Future research regarding this project is directed at validating the results on mixed enterprise traffic, extending the protocol coverage to HTTP/3/QUIC request, adding a benign traffic generation, and working on real-time traffic evaluation.

Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships.

While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.",2025-12-25

While these systems provide numerous benefits, their misuse raises safety and security concerns, making effective detection mechanisms essential. Acoustic sensing offers a low-cost and non-intrusive alternative to vision or radar-based detection, as drone propellers generate distinctive sound patterns. This study introduces AUDRON (AUdio-based Drone Recognition Network), a hybrid deep learning framework for drone sound detection, employing a combination of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms processed with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent layers for temporal modeling, and autoencoder-based representations. Feature-level fusion integrates complementary information before classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that AUDRON effectively differentiates drone acoustic signatures from background noise, achieving high accuracy while maintaining generalizability across varying conditions. AUDRON achieves 98.51 percent and 97.11 percent accuracy in binary and multiclass classification. The results highlight the advantage of combining multiple feature representations with deep learning for reliable acoustic drone detection, suggesting the framework's potential for deployment in security and surveillance applications where visual or radar sensing may be limited.",2025-12-25

Summarization can condense fragmented, emotion-rich posts, but existing methods-optimized for structured news-struggle with noisy, informal content. Emotional cues are critical for IS tasks such as brand monitoring and market analysis, yet few studies integrate sentiment modeling into summarization of short user-generated texts. We propose a sentiment-aware framework extending extractive (TextRank) and abstractive (UniLM) approaches by embedding sentiment signals into ranking and generation processes.

We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.",2025-12-25

Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20394v1,Resilient Packet Forwarding: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Routing in Gaussian Interconnected Networks with Clustered Faults,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: As Network-on-Chip (NoC) and Wireless Sensor Network architectures continue to scale, the topology of the underlying network becomes a critical factor in performance. Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies",2025-12-25

To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness.

It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20370v1,Cross-Population White Matter Atlas Creation for Concurrent Mapping of Brain Connections in Neonates and Adults with Diffusion MRI Tractography,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Comparing white matter (WM) connections between adults and neonates using diffusion MRI (dMRI) can advance our understanding of typical brain development and potential biomarkers for neurological disorders. However, existing WM atlases are population-specific (adult or neonatal) and reside in separate spaces, preventing direct cross-population comparisons. A unified WM atlas spanning both neonates and adults is still lacking. In this study, we propose a neonatal/adult brain atlas (NABA), a WM tractography atlas built from dMRI data of both neonates and adults. NABA is constructed using a robust, data-driven fiber clustering pipeline, enabling group-wise WM atlasing across populations despite substantial anatomical variability. The atlas provides a standardized template for WM parcellation, allowing direct comparison of WM tracts between neonates and adults. Using NABA, we conduct four analyses: (1) evaluating the feasibility of joint WM mapping across populations, (2) characterizing WM development across neonatal ages relative to adults, (3) assessing sex-related differences in neonatal WM development, and (4) examining the effects of preterm birth. Our results show that NABA robustly identifies WM tracts in both populations. We observe rapid fractional anisotropy (FA) development in long-range association tracts, including the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus II, whereas intra-cerebellar tracts develop more slowly. Neonatal females exhibit faster overall FA development than males. Although preterm neonates show lower overall FA development rates, they demonstrate relatively higher FA growth in specific tracts, including the corticospinal tract, corona radiata-pontine pathway, and intracerebellar tracts. These findings demonstrate that NABA is a useful tool for investigating WM development across neonates and adults.",2025-12-25

A growing body of work has shown that classical least-squares inference may fail under adaptive sampling, and that constructing valid confidence intervals for linear functionals of the model parameter typically requires paying an unavoidable inflation of order $\sqrt{d \log T}$. This phenomenon -- often referred to as the price of adaptivity -- highlights the inherent difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies.
  A key structural property that circumvents this limitation is the \emph{stability} condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to concentrate around a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals -- designed for i.i.d. data -- become asymptotically valid even under adaptation, \emph{without} incurring the $\sqrt{d \log T}$ price of adaptivity.
  In this paper, we propose and analyze a penalized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method. Finally, we complement our theory with simulations illustrating the empirical normality of the resulting estimators and the sharpness of the corresponding confidence intervals.",2025-12-25

However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.",2025-12-25

We present a multi-perspective validation framework for LLM-based thematic analysis that combines ensemble validation with dual reliability metrics: Cohen's Kappa ($κ$) for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency. Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate three leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on a psychedelic art therapy interview transcript, conducting six independent runs per model. Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability ($κ= 0.907$, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o ($κ= 0.853$, cosine=92.6%) and Claude ($κ= 0.842$, cosine=92.1%). All three models achieve a high agreement ($κ> 0.80$), validating the multi-run ensemble approach. The framework successfully extracts consensus themes across runs, with Gemini identifying 6 consensus themes (50-83% consistency), GPT-4o identifying 5 themes, and Claude 4 themes. Our open-source implementation provides researchers with transparent reliability metrics, flexible configuration, and structure-agnostic consensus extraction, establishing methodological foundations for reliable AI-assisted qualitative research.",2025-12-25

Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.",2025-12-25

As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.",2025-12-25

Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training.

Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings.

Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the ""synthesis cliff"" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20329v1,FedDPC : Handling Data Heterogeneity and Partial Client Participation in Federated Learning,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.",2025-12-25

However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions.

We also show that the Top-$K$ length vector is $2$-Lipschitz under bottleneck perturbations of the input barcode, and prove a comparison-model lower bound. Our experiments confirm the theory, showing speedups over full enumeration in high overlap cases.

We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models.

Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG).
  Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses.
  In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks.

This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation.

Constraint solvers enforce structural and perceptual validity, but the rules they require are difficult to author and too rigid to capture situated design knowledge. Large language models require no formal rules and can reason about contextual nuance, but they prioritize popular conventions over empirically grounded best practices. We address this tension by proposing a cataloging scheme that structures visualization design knowledge as natural-language guidelines with semantically typed metadata. This allows experts to author knowledge that machines can query. An expert study ($N=18$) indicates that practitioners routinely adapt heuristics to situational factors such as audience and communicative intent. To capture this reasoning, guideline sections specify not only advice but also the contexts where it applies, exceptions that invalidate it, and the sources from which it derives. We demonstrate the scheme's expressiveness by cataloging 744 guidelines drawn from cognitive science, accessibility standards, data journalism, and research on rhetorical aspects of visual communication. We embed guideline sections in a vector space, opening the knowledge itself to structural analysis. This reveals conflicting advice across sources and transferable principles between domains. Rather than replacing constraint-based tools, our scheme provides what they lack: situated guidance that generative systems can retrieve to ground their reasoning, users can verify against cited sources, and experts can author as knowledge evolves.",2025-12-25

CoxPH assumes constant hazard ratios, often failing to capture real-world dynamics, while traditional AFT models are limited by rigid distributional assumptions. Although deep learning models like DeepAFT address these constraints by improving predictive accuracy and handling censoring, they inherit the significant challenge of black-box interpretability. The recent introduction of CoxKAN demonstrated the successful integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a novel architecture that yields highly accurate and interpretable symbolic representations, within the CoxPH framework. Motivated by the interpretability gains of CoxKAN, we introduce KAN-AFT (Kolmogorov Arnold Network-based AFT), the first framework to apply KANs to the AFT model. KAN-AFT effectively models complex nonlinear relationships within the AFT framework. Our primary contributions include: (i) a principled AFT-KAN formulation, (ii) robust optimization strategies for right-censored observations (e.g., Buckley-James and IPCW), and (iii) an interpretability pipeline that converts the learned spline functions into closed-form symbolic equations for survival time. Empirical results on multiple datasets confirm that KAN-AFT achieves performance comparable to or better than DeepAFT, while uniquely providing transparent, symbolic models of the survival process.",2025-12-25

However, existing approaches largely rely on data-driven learning, making it difficult to capture the complex logic underlying decision-making through imitation or limited reinforcement rewards. To address this, we propose KnowVal, a new autonomous driving system that enables visual-language reasoning through the synergistic integration of open-world perception and knowledge retrieval. Specifically, we construct a comprehensive driving knowledge graph that encodes traffic laws, defensive driving principles, and ethical norms, complemented by an efficient LLM-based retrieval mechanism tailored for driving scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a human-preference dataset and train a Value Model to guide interpretable, value-aligned trajectory assessment. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves planning performance while remaining compatible with existing architectures. Notably, KnowVal achieves the lowest collision rate on nuScenes and state-of-the-art results on Bench2Drive.",2025-12-25

We present the first direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals in diagnosing Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders utilizing Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts. We show that the top-performing Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy by 21.91 percentage points (65.48% vs. 43.57%). While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 & F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term ""narcissism."" Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.",2025-12-25

With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.",2025-12-25

Existing moderation tools often treat safety risks (e.g. toxicity, bias) and adversarial threats (e.g. prompt injections, jailbreaks) as separate problems, limiting their robustness and generalizability. We introduce AprielGuard, an 8B parameter safeguard model that unify these dimensions within a single taxonomy and learning framework. AprielGuard is trained on a diverse mix of open and synthetic data covering standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with structured reasoning traces to improve interpretability. Across multiple public and proprietary benchmarks, AprielGuard achieves strong performance in detecting harmful content and adversarial manipulations, outperforming existing opensource guardrails such as Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning intensive scenarios.

However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation.

We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.",2025-12-25

We find that balancing solar and wind generation with pumped hydro energy storage eliminates the need for fossil gas without incurring a cost penalty. However, many existing long-term electricity system plans are biased to rely on fossil gas due to using temporal aggregation methods that either heavily constrain storage cycling behaviour or lose track of the state-of-charge, failing to consider the potential of low-cost long-duration off-river pumped hydro, and ignoring the broad suite of near-optimal energy transition pathways. We show that a temporal aggregation method based on 'segmentation' (fitted chronology) closely resembles the full-series optimisation, captures long-duration storage behaviour (48- and 160-hour durations), and finds a near-optimal 100% renewable electricity solution. We develop a new electricity system model to rapidly evaluate millions of other near-optimal solutions, stressing the importance of modelling pumped hydro sites with a low energy volume cost (<US$50 per kilowatt-hour), long economic lifetime (~75 years), and low real discount rate akin to other natural monopolies (<=3%).

Non-targeted analysis using LC/GC-HRMS handles these cases. But when findings trigger regulatory action, reproducibility becomes operational: can an independent laboratory repeat the analysis and reach the same conclusion?
  We assessed 103 tools (2004-2025) against six pillars drawn from FAIR and BP4NTA principles: laboratory validation (C1), data availability (C2), code availability (C3), standardised formats (C4), knowledge integration (C5), and portable implementation (C6). Health contributed 51 tools, Pharma 31, and Chemistry 21.
  Nine in ten tools shared data (C2, 90/103, 87%). Fewer than four in ten supported portable implementations (C6, 40/103, 39%). Validation and portability rarely appeared together (C1+C6, 18/103, 17%). Over twenty-one years, openness climbed from 56% to 86% while operability dropped from 55% to 43%.

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size.

Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs",2025-12-25

We present an initial feasibility study investigating their ability to produce realistic query distributions and execution plans for database workloads.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20270v1,Optimality-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Parametric Optimization Problems,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Many engineering tasks require solving families of nonlinear constrained optimization problems, parametrized in setting-specific variables. This is computationally demanding, particularly, if solutions have to be computed across strongly varying parameter values, e.g., in real-time control or for model-based design. Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method. These results suggest that embedding feasibility and optimality into the network architecture and loss can make learning-based surrogates more accurate, feasible, and data-efficient for parametric optimization.",2025-12-25

To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.",2025-12-25

We investigate two classic scenarios proposed in the literature, namely, Friends Appreciation ($\mathsf{FA}$) and Enemies Aversion ($\mathsf{EA}$): in the former, each agent primarily cares about the number of friends in her coalition, breaking ties based on the number of enemies, while in the latter, the opposite is true. For $\mathsf{EA}$, we show that our objective is hard to approximate within $O(n^{1-ε})$, for any fixed $ε>0$, and provide a polynomial-time $(n-1)$-approximation. For $\mathsf{FA}$, we obtain an NP-hardness result and a polynomial-time approximation algorithm. Our algorithm achieves a ratio of $2-Θ(\frac{1}{n})$ when every agent has at least two friends; however, if some agent has at most one friend, its approximation ratio deteriorates to $n/2$. We recover the $2-Θ(\frac{1}{n})$ approximation ratio for two important variants: when randomization is allowed and when the friendship relationship is symmetric. Additionally, for both $\mathsf{EA}$ and $\mathsf{FA}$ we identify special cases where the optimal egalitarian partition can be computed in polynomial time.",2025-12-25

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.",2025-12-25

However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.",2025-12-25

The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via ""Signal Consensus"" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal.",2025-12-25

However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.",2025-12-25

Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.",2025-12-25

Rather than treating empathy as a binary capability, this study examines how different levels of empathic expression in virtual human interaction influence user experience. We conducted a between-subject experiment (n = 70) in a counseling-style interaction context, comparing three virtual human conditions: a neutral dialogue-based agent, a dialogue-based empathic agent, and a video-based empathic agent that incorporates users' facial cues. Participants engaged in a 15-minute interaction and subsequently evaluated their experience using subjective measures of empathy and interaction quality. Results from analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences across conditions in affective empathy, perceived naturalness of facial movement, and appropriateness of facial expression. The video-based empathic expression condition elicited significantly higher affective empathy than the neutral baseline (p < .001) and marginally higher levels than the dialogue-based condition (p < .10). In contrast, cognitive empathy did not differ significantly across conditions. These findings indicate that empathic expression in virtual humans should be conceptualized as a graded design variable, rather than a binary capability, with visually grounded cues playing a decisive role in shaping affective user experience.",2025-12-25

We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.",2025-12-25

Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.",2025-12-25

Designed to leverage quantitative techniques for enhanced risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies in volatile environments, the architecture employs FinBERT, a transformer-based NLP model, to extract sentiment from ESG texts, followed by unsupervised clustering (UMAP/HDBSCAN) to identify 5 latent ESG regimes, validated via PCA. These regimes are mapped to economic conditions using a dense neural network and gradient boosting classifier, achieving 84.04% training and 82.0% validation accuracy. Concurrently, time-series models (SRNN, MLP, LSTM, GRU) forecast daily closing prices, with GRU attaining an R-squared of 0.801 and LSTM delivering 52.78% directional accuracy on intraday data. A strong correlation between S&P SL20 and S&P 500, observed through moving average and volatility trend plots, further bolsters forecasting precision. A rule-based fusion logic merges ESG and time-series outputs for final market signals. By addressing literature gaps that overlook emerging markets and holistic integration, this quant-driven framework combines global correlations and local sentiment analysis to offer scalable, accurate tools for quantitative finance professionals navigating complex markets like Sri Lanka.",2025-12-25

However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios.",2025-12-25

Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning.

To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.
  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings.

The price spread rises with order size, strike, maturity, and estimated volatility, and falls with trading volume.

As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines. The implementation of DuoCore-FS, including training, inference, and deployment, is provided to commercial users by Astribot as part of the Astribot robotic platform.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20184v1,Reaching Agreement Among Reasoning LLM Agents,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Multi-agent systems have extended the capability of agentic AI. Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem.
  To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%. Consistent gains across both local GPU deployments and commercial API providers validate that consensus-based orchestration eliminates straggler delays without sacrificing correctness.",2025-12-25

In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3.

Structural differences across hackathon formats raise important questions about how event design can shape student learning experiences and engagement. This study examines two distinct hackathon formats: a gender-specific hackathon (GS) and a regular institutional hackathon (RI). Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyze variations in team dynamics, project themes, role assignments, and environmental settings. Our findings indicate that GS hackathon foster a collaborative and supportive atmosphere, emphasizing personal growth and community learning, with projects often centered on health and well-being. In contrast, RI hackathon tend to promote a competitive, outcome-driven environment, with projects frequently addressing entertainment and environmental sustainability.

To address this limitation, we present RESPOND, a structured decision-making framework for LLM-driven agents grounded in explicit risk patterns. RESPOND represents each ego-centric scene using a unified 5 by 3 matrix that encodes spatial topology and road constraints, enabling consistent and reliable retrieval of spatial risk configurations. Based on this representation, a hybrid rule and LLM decision pipeline is developed with a two-tier memory mechanism. In high-risk contexts, exact pattern matching enables rapid and safe reuse of verified actions, while in low-risk contexts, sub-pattern matching supports personalized driving style adaptation. In addition, a pattern-aware reflection mechanism abstracts tactical corrections from crash and near-miss frames to update structured memory, achieving one-crash-to-generalize learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RESPOND. In highway-env, RESPOND outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and reinforcement learning based driving agents while producing substantially fewer collisions. With step-wise human feedback, the agent acquires a Sporty driving style within approximately 20 decision steps through sub-pattern abstraction. For real-world validation, RESPOND is evaluated on 53 high-risk cut-in scenarios extracted from the HighD dataset. For each event, intervention is applied immediately before the cut-in and RESPOND re-decides the driving action. Compared to recorded human behavior, RESPOND reduces subsequent risk in 84.9 percent of scenarios, demonstrating its practical feasibility under real-world driving conditions. These results highlight RESPONDs potential for autonomous driving, personalized driving assistance, and proactive hazard mitigation.",2025-12-25

The major performance bottleneck in distributed SpMM lies in the substantial communication overhead, which limits both performance and scalability. In this paper, we identify and analyze sources of inefficient communication in existing distributed SpMM implementations at two levels and address these inefficiencies by proposing: (1) a fine-grained, sparsity-aware communication strategy that reduces communication overhead by exploiting the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix, and (2) a hierarchical communication strategy that integrates the sparsity-aware strategy with the common two-tier network architectures in GPU-accelerated systems, to reduce redundant communication across slow network links. We implement these optimizations in a comprehensive distributed SpMM framework, \method{}. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our framework demonstrates strong scalability up to 128 GPUs, achieving geometric mean speedups of 221.5$\times$, 56.0$\times$, 23.4$\times$, and 8.8$\times$ over four state-of-the-art baselines (CAGNET, SPA, BCL, and CoLa, respectively) at this scale.",2025-12-25

They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.",2025-12-25

Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency.

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.",2025-12-25

Hash technique has shown its superiority for speeding up the online recommendation by bit operations on Hamming distance computations. However, existing hashing-based recommendations suffer from low accuracy, especially with sparse settings, due to the limited representation capability of each bit and neglected inherent relations among users and items. To this end, this paper lodges a Collaborative Group-Aware Hashing (CGAH) method for both collaborative filtering (namely CGAH-CF) and content-aware recommendations (namely CGAH) by integrating the inherent group information to alleviate the sparse issue. Firstly, we extract inherent group affinities of users and items by classifying their latent vectors into different groups. Then, the preference is formulated as the inner product of the group affinity and the similarity of hash codes. By learning hash codes with the inherent group information, CGAH obtains more effective hash codes than other discrete methods with sparse interactive data. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superior performance of our proposed CGAH and CGAH-CF over the state-of-the-art discrete collaborative filtering methods and discrete content-aware recommendations under different sparse settings.",2025-12-25

We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models.

However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate. It exposes a fundamental blind spot in existing defenses, and calls for rethinking cross-modal security in MLLM-integrated systems.",2025-12-25

However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by ""adversarial instructions"" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20163v1,Population Protocols Revisited: Parity and Beyond,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: For nearly two decades, population protocols have been extensively studied, yielding efficient solutions for central problems in distributed computing, including leader election, and majority computation, a predicate type in Presburger Arithmetic closely tied to population protocols. Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$.
  Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols. Specifically, the first efficient parity and congruence protocols introduced here use both $O(\log^3 n)$ states and achieve silent stabilisation in $O(\log^3 n)$ time. We conclude by discussing the impact of implicit conversion between unary and binary representations enabled by the weight system, with applications to other problems, including the computation and representation of (sub-)population sizes.",2025-12-25

The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model.

Conventional rule-based metrics merely score programs based on their surface-level similarities with reference programs instead of analyzing functionality and code quality in depth. To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors. Others propose fine-grained but subjective, vaguely-defined evaluation criteria, introducing unreliability in manually-annotated scores, which is the ground-truth they rely on. Furthermore, they often use uncontrolled data synthesis methods, leading to unbalanced score distributions that poorly represent real-world code generation scenarios.
  To curate a diverse benchmark with programs of well-balanced distributions across various quality levels and streamline the manual annotation procedure, we propose AXIOM, a novel perturbation-based framework for synthesizing code evaluation benchmarks at scale. It reframes program scores as the refinement effort needed for deployment, consisting of two stages: (1) Rule-guided perturbation, which prompts LLMs to apply sequences of predefined perturbation rules to existing high-quality programs to modify their functionality and code quality, enabling us to precisely control each program's target score to achieve balanced score distributions.

First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20145v1,Retrieval-augmented Prompt Learning for Pre-trained Foundation Models,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20144v1,Multi-hop Reasoning via Early Knowledge Alignment,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.",2025-12-25

Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.",2025-12-25

We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed ""thinking"" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open ""thinking"" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed ""thinking"" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.",2025-12-25

Therefore, numerous studies were conducted to examine communication patterns in esports teams. While non-verbal communication has been extensively investigated, research on assessing voice-based verbal communication patterns remains relatively understudied. In this study, we propose a framework that automatically assesses verbal communication patterns by constructing networks with utterances transcribed from voice recordings. Through a data collection study, we obtained 84 game sessions from five League of Legends teams and subsequently investigated how verbal communication patterns varied across different conditions. As a result, we revealed that esports players exhibited broader and more balanced participation in collaborative situations, increased utterances over time with the largest rise in decision making, and team-level differences that were contingent on effective professional training. Building upon these findings, this study provides a generalizable tool for analyzing effective team communication.",2025-12-25

However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.",2025-12-25

Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success. This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search. Across NASBench-101 and NASBench-201, DCL-ENAS achieves the highest validation accuracy, surpassing the strongest published baselines by 0.05\% (ImageNet16-120) to 0.39\% (NASBench-101). On a real-world ECG arrhythmia classification task, DCL-ENAS improves performance by approximately 2.5 percentage points over a manually designed, non-NAS model obtained via random search, while requiring only 7.7 GPU-days.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20111v1,ABBEL: LLM Agents Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.",2025-12-25

Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.",2025-12-25

This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.",2025-12-25

To this end, we propose Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP), a new learning paradigm for rich-text graph representation learning. Besides considering similarity regarding structure and text, JSDMP further captures their corresponding dissimilarity by Jensen-Shannon divergence. Similarity and dissimilarity are then jointly used to compute new message weights among text nodes, thus enabling representations to learn with contextual and structural information from truly correlated text nodes. With JSDMP, we propose two novel graph neural networks, namely Divergent message-passing graph convolutional network (DMPGCN) and Divergent message-passing Page-Rank graph neural networks (DMPPRG), for learning representations in rich-text graphs. DMPGCN and DMPPRG have been extensively texted on well-established rich-text datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.

However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories.

  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset.

In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies.

It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.",2025-12-25

Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods.

Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.",2025-12-25

As the problems become more complex, the scale of MPS is rapidly increasing. Traditional data parallelism is limited by memory and heavy I/O in large-scale MPS. Model parallelism that can handle large-scale MPS imposes rigid process bindings and lacks scalability. This work proposes Fast-MPS, a multi-level parallel framework for scalable MPS sampling.

DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20062v1,On the Effectiveness of Instruction-Tuning Local LLMs for Identifying Software Vulnerabilities,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating software vulnerability analysis, a critical task given the impact of security failure of modern software systems. However, current approaches in using LLMs to automate vulnerability analysis mostly rely on using online API-based LLM services, requiring the user to disclose the source code in development. Moreover, they predominantly frame the task as a binary classification(vulnerable or not vulnerable), limiting potential practical utility. This paper addresses these limitations by reformulating the problem as Software Vulnerability Identification (SVI), where LLMs are asked to output the type of weakness in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs rather than simply indicating the presence or absence of a vulnerability. We also tackle the reliance on large, API-based LLMs by demonstrating that instruction-tuning smaller, locally deployable LLMs can achieve superior identification performance. In our analysis, instruct-tuning a local LLM showed better overall performance and cost trade-off than online API-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that instruct-tuned local models represent a more effective, secure, and practical approach for leveraging LLMs in real-world vulnerability management workflows.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20061v1,Scaling Reinforcement Learning for Content Moderation with Large Language Models,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.",2025-12-25

Accurately predicting student engagement is essential for optimizing teaching strategies and providing personalized interventions. However, most approaches focus on single-dimensional feature analysis and assessing engagement based on individual student factors. In this work, we propose a dual-stream multi-feature fusion model based on hypergraph convolutional networks (DS-HGCN), incorporating social contagion of student engagement. DS-HGCN enables accurate prediction of student engagement states by modeling multi-dimensional features and their propagation mechanisms between students. The framework constructs a hypergraph structure to encode engagement contagion among students and captures the emotional and behavioral differences and commonalities by multi-frequency signals. Furthermore, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism to dynamically weigh the influence of each student, accounting for individual differences in the propagation process. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.",2025-12-25

To overcome the spectral instability and mode switching inherent in non-selfadjoint operators, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns the stable invariant eigensubspace mapping rather than individual eigenfunctions. We proposed a Deep Eigenspace Network (DEN) architecture integrating Fourier Neural Operators, geometry-adaptive POD bases, and explicit banded cross-mode mixing mechanisms to capture complex spectral dependencies on unstructured meshes. We apply DEN to the parametric non-selfadjoint Steklov eigenvalue problem and provide theoretical proofs for the Lipschitz continuity of the eigensubspace with respect to the parameters. In addition, we derive error bounds for the reconstruction of the eigenspace. Numerical experiments validate DEN's high accuracy and zero-shot generalization capabilities across different discretizations.",2025-12-25

Our goal is two-fold: the first is to preserve the tensor structure when performing dimension reduction, particularly the meaning of the tensor modes, for improved interpretation; the second is to substantially reduce the number of parameters in dimension reduction, thereby achieving model parsimony and enhancing estimation accuracy. Our two tensor dimension reduction methods echo the two commonly used tensor decomposition mechanisms: one is the Tucker decomposition, which reduces a larger tensor to a smaller one; the other is the CP-decomposition, which represents an arbitrary tensor as a sequence of rank-one tensors. We developed the Fisher consistency of our methods at the population level and established their consistency and convergence rates. Both methods are easy to implement numerically: the Tucker-form can be implemented through a sequence of least-squares steps, and the CP-form can be implemented through a sequence of singular value decompositions. We investigated the finite-sample performance of our methods and showed substantial improvement in accuracy over existing methods in simulations and two data applications.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20617v1,SpatialTree: How Spatial Abilities Branch Out in MLLMs,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive ""thinking"" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.",2025-12-25

We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.",2025-12-25

We here demonstrate maser oscillation in a microwave cavity containing a crystal of pentacene-doped \textit{para}-terphenyl (ptc:ptp) pumped by a single, chip-scale LED. Here, unlike previous work, the size of the pump source no longer dominates the size of the maser system as a whole. This miniaturization is achieved through invasive optical pumping in the form of a waveguide, the tip of which is embedded into the maser crystal. Combining experimental measurements with ray-tracing analysis, we find that our approach offers at least a factor of 2 enhancement in the cooperativity over end-on optical excitation.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20591v1,LightTact: A Visual-Tactile Fingertip Sensor for Deformation-Independent Contact Sensing,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Contact often occurs without macroscopic surface deformation, such as during interaction with liquids, semi-liquids, or ultra-soft materials. Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction. Finally, we show that LightTact's spatially aligned visual-tactile images can be directly interpreted by existing vision-language models, enabling resistor value reasoning for robotic sorting.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20583v1,Making Sense of Private Advertising: A Principled Approach to a Complex Ecosystem,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: In this work, we model the end-to-end pipeline of the advertising ecosystem, allowing us to identify two main issues with the current trajectory of private advertising proposals. First, prior work has largely considered ad targeting and engagement metrics individually rather than in composition. This has resulted in privacy notions that, while reasonable for each protocol in isolation, fail to compose to a natural notion of privacy for the ecosystem as a whole, permitting advertisers to extract new information about the audience of their advertisements. The second issue serves to explain the first: we prove that \textit{perfect} privacy is impossible for any, even minimally, useful advertising ecosystem, due to the advertisers' expectation of conducting market research on the results.
  Having demonstrated that leakage is inherent in advertising, we re-examine what privacy could realistically mean in advertising, building on the well-established notion of \textit{sensitive} data in a specific context. We identify that fundamentally new approaches are needed when designing privacy-preserving advertising subsystems in order to ensure that the privacy properties of the end-to-end advertising system are well aligned with people's privacy desires.",2025-12-25

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20561v1,FlashVLM: Text-Guided Visual Token Selection for Large Multimodal Models,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.",2025-12-25

To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20556v1,Multi-Grained Text-Guided Image Fusion for Multi-Exposure and Multi-Focus Scenarios,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.",2025-12-25

As these documents are used by LLM-driven systems (e.g., in RAG) the problem is exacerbated as LLMs can leak sensitive data due to prompt truncation, classification errors, or loss of system context. We introduce \our, a system designed to provide RBAC in RAG systems. \our implements layered input/output validation, role-aware retrieval, and post-generation fact-checking. Unlike traditional RBAC approaches that rely on fine-tuned classifiers, \our uses LLMs operating in few-shot settings with prompt-based steering for rapid deployment and role updates. We evaluate the approach on 389 queries using a synthetic dataset. Experimental results show 85\% accuracy and 89\% F1-score in query filtering, close to traditional RBAC solutions. Results suggest that practical RBAC deployment on RAG systems is approaching the maturity level needed for dynamic enterprise environments.",2025-12-25

The technique has also opened up a new dimension for cryo-EM sample preparation, making it possible to deposit compounds onto a cryo-EM sample while it is frozen, so that upon flash melting, the embedded particles experience an altered environment. For example, we have recently shown that depositing ultrathin silicon dioxide membranes onto a cryo-EM sample causes particles to detach from the interface upon flash melting, removing preferred particle orientation. These experiments also point towards a new strategy for initiating protein dynamics in time resolved experiments by depositing reagents, which will then mix with the sample upon flash melting. Here, we describe an apparatus for physical vapor deposition of compounds onto cryo-EM samples, detailing its design and operation. As a demonstration, we determine that the minimum thickness of silicon dioxide sealing membranes in a laser flash melting experiment is just over two monolayers. We propose that our design can form the basis for an integrated platform for microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM experiments.",2025-12-25

We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.
  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.
  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.

Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.",2025-12-25

It connects the spin-dependent cross-section for photoproduction off a particle to the squared ratio of the particle's anomalous magnetic moment and its mass, $(κ/M)^2$. Thus, for a nucleon embedded in a nucleus, the sum rule relates the cross-section to $κ/M$ averaged quadratically over the nucleons comprising the nucleus. This quadratic averaging can be used to constrain the mechanism responsible for the medium modification of the nucleon. We also point out that the global properties of the embedded nucleon like its axial charge, mass or magnetic moment are observables measurable through sum rules.",2025-12-25

Review Rejected,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are now widely used in writing and reviewing scientific papers. While this trend accelerates publication growth and reduces human workload, it also introduces serious risks. Papers written or reviewed by LLMs may lack real novelty, contain fabricated or biased results, or mislead downstream research that others depend on. Such issues can damage reputations, waste resources, and even endanger lives when flawed studies influence medical or safety-critical systems. This research explores both the offensive and defensive sides of this growing threat. On the attack side, we demonstrate how an author can inject hidden prompts inside a PDF that secretly guide or ""jailbreak"" LLM reviewers into giving overly positive feedback and biased acceptance. On the defense side, we propose an ""inject-and-detect"" strategy for editors, where invisible trigger prompts are embedded into papers; if a review repeats or reacts to these triggers, it reveals that the review was generated by an LLM, not a human. This method turns prompt injections from vulnerability into a verification tool. We outline our design, expected model behaviors, and ethical safeguards for deployment. The goal is to expose how fragile today's peer-review process becomes under LLM influence and how editorial awareness can help restore trust in scientific evaluation.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20385v1,Generalized method of L-moment estimation for stationary and nonstationary extreme value models,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Precisely estimating out-of-sample upper quantiles is very important in risk assessment and in engineering practice for structural design to prevent a greater disaster. For this purpose, the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution has been broadly used. To estimate the parameters of GEV distribution, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and L-moment estimation (LME) methods have been primarily employed. For a better estimation using the MLE, several studies considered the generalized MLE (penalized likelihood or Bayesian) methods to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information for parameters. However, a generalized LME method for the same purpose has not been developed yet in the literature. We thus propose the generalized method of L-moment estimation (GLME) to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information. The proposed estimation is based on the generalized L-moment distance and a multivariate normal likelihood approximation. Because the L-moment estimator is more efficient and robust for small samples than the MLE, we reasonably expect the advantages of LME to continue to hold for GLME. The proposed method is applied to the stationary and nonstationary GEV models with two novel (data-adaptive) penalty functions to correct the bias of LME. A simulation study indicates that the biases of LME are considerably corrected by the GLME with slight increases in the standard error. Applications to US flood damage data and maximum rainfall at Phliu Agromet in Thailand illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method. This study may promote further work on penalized or Bayesian inferences based on L-moments.",2025-12-25

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20362v1,CRAFT: Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning for Multimodal Text-to-Image Generation,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.",2025-12-25

In this broad setting, the scaling limits are described in terms of solutions to conjugate Beltrami equations with prescribed singularities. For the underlying Ising model, this leads to the scaling limit of the energy-energy correlations and reveals a connection between the scaling limits of (near-)critical planar Ising models and quasiconformal mappings. For grids approximating bounded domains in the complex plane, we establish, in the scaling regime, the conformal covariance of the energy density on critical doubly periodic graphs. We complement this result with an analogous statement in the case where the limiting conformal structure generates a maximal surface $(z,\vartheta)$ in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{(2,1)}$. All scaling factors obtained are local and expressed in terms of the geometry of the embedding, even in situations where they vary drastically from one region to another.
  These results confirm the predictions of Chelkak and highlight that the scaling limits of generic (near-)critical Ising models naturally live on a substantially richer conformal structure than the classical Euclidean one.",2025-12-25

While tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial fusion, typically implemented through an acoustic Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) integrated with visual-inertial measurements, can provide accurate state estimation, the associated graph-based optimization is often computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Here we present FAR-AVIO, a Schur-Complement based, tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework tailored for underwater robots. FAR-AVIO embeds a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), enabling joint pose-landmark optimization for accuracy while maintaining constant-time updates by efficiently marginalizing landmark states. On top of this backbone, we introduce Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation(AWARE), an online sensor health module that continuously assesses the reliability of visual, inertial and DVL measurements and adaptively regulates their sigma weights, and we develop an efficient online calibration scheme that jointly estimates DVL-IMU extrinsics, without dedicated calibration manoeuvres.

At the same time, studies have identified potential defects in the generated code. Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate.
  This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags. Even with explicit instructions to ignore the defective CO code, the reduction in defects does not exceed 21.84 percent. These findings underscore the need for improved robustness and security measures in AI coding assistants.",2025-12-25

From high-efficiency magnets in wind turbines to advanced batteries and solar photovoltaics, REEs are indispensable for a greener world through the energy transition. However, supply chains remain a barrier for the majority of the global population. India is mainly dependent on imports for most REEs. Innovation and recycling efforts in most REEs are still in their early stages. For India, aspiring to Viksit Bharat by 2047, securing sustainable REE access is critical to national energy security and technological independence. This paper explores India's opportunities and challenges in the REE domain, high-lighting underutilized resources such as copper tailings, fly ash, and e-waste. We argue for circular economy pathways that can reduce environmental impacts and strengthen domestic supply. Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL), as India's sole vertically integrated copper producer, is uniquely positioned to pioneer co-recovery of REEs, advance research and development partnerships, and build a comprehensive supply chain. By embedding sustainability, ESG principles, and community trust in its strategy, HCL can evolve into a national champion in this domain.",2025-12-25

Chai, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 154104 (2012)] has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate electronic structure method for studying the ground-state properties of large multi-reference (MR) systems at absolute zero. To explore the thermal equilibrium properties of large MR systems at finite electronic temperatures, in the present work, we propose the finite-temperature (FT) extension of TAO-DFT, denoted as FT-TAO-DFT. Besides, to unlock the dynamical information of large MR systems at finite temperatures, FT-TAO-DFT is combined with ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to FT-TAO-AIMD. In addition, we also develop FT-TAO-DFT-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), denoted as FT-TAO-QM/MM, to provide a cost-effective description of the thermal equilibrium properties of a QM subsystem with MR character embedded in an MM environment at finite temperatures. Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene.",2025-12-25

The paradox has been solved previously by various researchers, and the energy lost during the charging of capacitors has been primarily attributed to the heat and radiation. We analytically prove this for various standard resistor-capacitor (RC) and resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit models. From the perspective of electronic system security, electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis (SCA) has recently gained significant prominence with the growth of resource-constrained, internet connected devices. This article connects the energy lost due to capacitor charging to the EM SCA leakage in electronic devices, leading to the recovery of the secret encryption key embedded within the device. Finally, with an understanding of how lost energy relates to EM radiation, we propose adiabatic charging as a solution to minimize EM leakage, thereby paving the way towards low-overhead EM SCA resilience.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20290v1,A non-compact QCD axion,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: We investigate the cosmology of an axion that is fundamentally non-compact. During inflation, fluctuations of the effectively massless field populate many QCD vacua, thereby evading conventional isocurvature constraints while generating domain walls -- without accompanying cosmic strings. A small non-QCD contribution to the axion potential is required to trigger the timely collapse of domain walls; as a consequence, a residual amount of CP violation in the strong sector must exist, potentially within reach of planned experiments. Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies. Such axion dynamics can be embedded in top-down constructions -- such as Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity -- where the tilting of the axion potential arises automatically.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20257v1,LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.",2025-12-25

However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20217v1,LiteFusion: Taming 3D Object Detectors from Vision-Based to Multi-Modal with Minimal Adaptation,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20213v1,JDPNet: A Network Based on Joint Degradation Processing for Underwater Image Enhancement,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.",2025-12-25

An important class of such media lacks a single characteristic relaxation timescale when subjected to a time-dependent stress. Rather, the stress response spans a broad continuum of timescales, a behavior naturally described by a scale-free, fractal-like power-law relaxation modulus. Using a generalization of the fractional Langevin equation, we investigate an active Brownian particle embedded in a power-law viscoelastic environment with translational and rotational dynamics governed by independent fractional orders. We solve the model analytically, develop a numerical scheme to validate the theoretical predictions, and provide tools that can be used in further studies. A rich variety of diffusion regimes emerges, which modify the intermediate-time behavior of the mean squared displacement. Notably, we find that the competition between translational and rotational contributions favors a superdiffusive persistence over the standard ballistic motion, and over-stretches its characteristic timescale, fundamentally altering the standard relation between persistence and propulsion in active matter.",2025-12-25

One promising approach to alleviate this burden is Embedded Index Coding (EIC), which exploits cached data at user nodes to encode transmissions more efficiently. However, most prior work on EIC has focused on minimizing code length in wired, error-free environments-an objective often suboptimal for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where channel conditions and spatial multiplexing gains must be considered. This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems.",2025-12-25

However, such capabilities are often overlooked by existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation. We first employ Vision-Language Models to encode rich contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations. We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable ""embodiment-anchored"" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots. Results show that LoLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods (e.g., pi0), particularly in long-horizon manipulation tasks.",2025-12-25

Our results call into question the common interpretation that TVPs are due to ""structural instabilities"". Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we model a set of macroeconomic and financial variables as a TVP-VAR with a factor-structure in TVPs. This reveals that most instabilities are driven by a few factors, which comove strongly with measures of macroeconomic uncertainty and the contribution of finance to real economic activity, commonly emphasized as important sources of non-linearities in macroeconomics. Furthermore, our model yields improved forecasts relative to the standard TVP-VAR where TVPs evolve as independent random walks.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20141v1,Worth the Effort? An Examination on the Effect of Higher Diligence Calculations of the Sound Shell Model,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: The gravitational wave spectrum arising from using the full velocity profile is well known to differ qualitatively from analytic fits to a broken power law. Former studies have shown that unlike the uncertainties arising from thermal field theory, more diligence in the hydrodynamics can sometimes have limited benefit. However, this was shown in the context of broken power law fits. We test the benefits of some recent calculations in modeling the spectrum, including new developments in adjustments of the low frequency tail to be consistent with causality, but we use the full velocity profile. We find the spectral shape information has a heightened sensitivity to the speed of sound which can be demonstrated analytically, however for our benchmark model this still results in a modest difference. The reason for a heightened sensitivity is because the velocity at the boundary is quite sensitive to the speed of sound, which in turn means a small change to the speed of sound can have a large change to the shape of the velocity profile. Furthermore, even modest changes in the product $ακ$ can make non-trivial changes to the shape around the peak. Finally, there are many points where adjusting the infrared behavior to be consistent with causality is affecting the spectrum near its peak. All this implies that the spectrum is sensitive to five thermal parameters rather than four which gives hope that an observation of a gravitational wave spectrum from a first order cosmological phase transition could eventually give even more information about the underlying microphysics responsible.",2025-12-25

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques.

Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes.

Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.",2025-12-25

In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring"" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.",2025-12-25

However, the dynamic characteristics of satellite network topology, limited quantum resources, and strict coherence time constraints pose significant challenges to reliable entanglement routing. An entanglement distribution analysis model for this unique environment is critical and helpful for entanglement routing research. We address the fundamental challenge of establishing and maintaining quantum entanglement links between satellites operating in free space, where links are subject to both transmission losses and quantum memory decoherence. This paper presents a comprehensive Markov chain model with a state space defined by link storage age and physical distance for analyzing entanglement distribution in noisy dynamic LEO satellite quantum networks. We construct transition matrices that capture system dynamics under varying request arrival rates, and derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including request satisfaction rate, average waiting time, link utilization efficiency, and average consumed link fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the critical trade-offs of higher request rates lead to faster link consumption with higher fidelity but potentially lower satisfaction rates, while lower request rates allow longer storage times at the cost of lower fidelity of increased decoherence effect. Moreover, this paper proves it is reasonable to leave out polarization rotation when the transmission distance is very short (40-50 km). In summary, this work provides theoretical foundations for designing and optimizing quantum entanglement distribution strategies in satellite networks, with applications to global-scale quantum communications.",2025-12-25

This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions.

Despite the advancements in Large Multimodal Models for design-to-code translation, existing methodologies predominantly yield unstructured, flat codebases that lack compatibility with component-oriented libraries such as React or Angular. Such outputs typically exhibit low cohesion and high coupling, complicating long-term maintenance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VSA (VSA)}, a multi-stage paradigm designed to synthesize organized frontend assets through visual-structural alignment. Our approach first employs a spatial-aware transformer to reconstruct the visual input into a hierarchical tree representation. Moving beyond basic layout extraction, we integrate an algorithmic pattern-matching layer to identify recurring UI motifs and encapsulate them into modular templates. These templates are then processed via a schema-driven synthesis engine, ensuring the Large Language Model generates type-safe, prop-drilled components suitable for production environments.

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.",2025-12-25

Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets.",2025-12-25

However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",2025-12-25

This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.",2025-12-25

Personalizing Vision-Language-Action Models with Visual Attentive Prompting,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as ""bring my cup"", where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20013v1,SegEarth-R2: Towards Comprehensive Language-guided Segmentation for Remote Sensing Images,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.",2025-12-25

In recent years, Android graph-based deep learning research has proposed many approaches to extract relationships from applications as graphs to generate graph embeddings. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based classifier to generate API graph embeddings. The graph embeddings are combined with Permission and Intent features to train multiple machine learning and deep learning models for Android malware detection. The proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of 98.33 percent on the CICMaldroid dataset and 98.68 percent on the Drebin dataset. However, graph-based deep learning models are vulnerable, as attackers can add fake relationships to evade detection by the classifier. Second, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based attack algorithm named VGAE-MalGAN targeting graph-based GNN Android malware classifiers. The VGAE-MalGAN generator produces adversarial malware API graphs, while the VGAE-MalGAN substitute detector attempts to mimic the target detector. Experimental results show that VGAE-MalGAN can significantly reduce the detection rate of GNN-based malware classifiers. Although the model initially fails to detect adversarial malware, retraining with generated adversarial samples improves robustness and helps mitigate adversarial attacks.",2025-12-25

Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.",2025-12-25

We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.",2025-12-25

However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.",2025-12-25

Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Structure-based MRSs have achieved state-of-the-art performance by constructing semantic item graphs, which explicitly model relationships between items based on modality feature similarity. However, such semantic item graphs are often noisy due to 1) inherent noise in multimodal information and 2) misalignment between item semantics and user-item co-occurrence relationships, which introduces false links and leads to suboptimal recommendations. To address this challenge, we propose Item Graph Diffusion for Multimodal Recommendation (IGDMRec), a novel method that leverages a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to denoise the semantic item graph by integrating user behavioral information. Specifically, IGDMRec introduces a Behavior-conditioned Graph Diffusion (BGD) module, incorporating interaction data as conditioning information to guide the denoising of the semantic item graph. Additionally, a Conditional Denoising Network (CD-Net) is designed to implement the denoising process with manageable complexity. Finally, we propose a contrastive representation augmentation scheme that leverages both the denoised item graph and the original item graph to enhance item representations. \LL{Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of IGDMRec over competitive baselines, with robustness analysis validating its denoising capability and ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of its key components.",2025-12-25

Existing neuron interpretability techniques from NLP are suboptimal for source code due to programming languages formal, hierarchical, and executable nature. We empirically investigate code LLMs at the neuron level, localizing language-specific neurons (selectively responsive to one language) and concept layers (feed-forward layers encoding language-agnostic code representations). We analyze Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B on multilingual inputs in C++, Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript, measuring neuron selectivity and layerwise contributions during generation. We find (1) neurons specialized for individual languages alongside a universal subset supporting general-purpose generation; and (2) lower layers mainly encode language-specific syntax, while middle layers capture semantic abstractions shared across languages, emerging as concept layers. We demonstrate utility on three tasks: neuron-guided fine-tuning for code generation, clone detection via concept-layer embeddings, and concept-layer-guided transfer for code summarization, each yielding consistent gains in multilingual settings.",2025-12-25

Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning. Particularly, we emphasize task heterogeneity in distributed learning pattern covering federated learning (FL), multi-agent domain adaptation (MADA), federated multi-modal learning (FML), federated continual learning (FCL), federated multi-task learning (FMTL), and federated graph knowledge embedding (FKGE). Additionally, we highlight model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, resource heterogeneity, and privacy concerns of these tasks.

Any explanation invoked to explain LyC escape must agree with this dramatic cosmic evolution. Galaxy mergers are often suggested as such a regulating mechanism. They occur an order or magnitude more frequently at $z \ge 3$ than in the local Universe, and they can trigger LyC escape either by inducing strong nuclear starbursts, or by tidally displacing the neutral ISM from the bulk of the stars. In the local Universe, LyC escape has been found to correlate with a range of physical and observable properties closely associated with strong star formation. For this reason, interest in mergers as drivers of LyC escape have been mainly focused on their capacity to induce strong star formation. However, at $z \ge 2$, these correlations are weaker, and we observe a much more diverse Lyman Continuum Emitter (LCE) population. This suggests that processes external to the LCE galaxies are more important for facilitating the escape at higher redshifts, which makes tidal displacement an interesting explanatory model; however, this has only been conclusively observed once before. In this letter, we present archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU and HST UVIS and IR imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum emitter LACES104037. We find that its Lyman-Continuum escape originates in a tidal bridge in the direction towards an interacting companion galaxy first identified in this work. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features could help explain both the higher cosmic LyC escape fraction and the greater diversity of LCE galaxy properties at higher redshifts.",2025-12-25

Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331.

Existing analysis methods, such as static analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing, depend on binary visibility and functional emulation, making them unreliable when firmware is encrypted or inaccessible. To address this limitation, we propose a binary-free, architecture-agnostic solution that estimates the likelihood of conceptual zero-day vulnerabilities using only high-level descriptors. The approach integrates a tri-LLM reasoning architecture combining a LLaMA-based configuration interpreter, a DeepSeek-based structural abstraction analyzer, and a GPT-4o semantic fusion model. The solution also incorporates LLM computational signatures, including latency patterns, uncertainty markers, and reasoning depth indicators, as well as an energy-aware symbolic load model, to enhance interpretability and operational feasibility. In addition, we formally derive the mathematical foundations of the reasoning pipeline, establishing monotonicity, divergence, and energy-risk coupling properties that theoretically justify the model's behavior. Simulation-based evaluation reveals that high exposure conditions increase the predicted zero-day likelihood by 20 to 35 percent across models, with GPT-4o demonstrating the strongest cross-layer correlations and the highest sensitivity. Energy and divergence metrics significantly predict elevated risk (p < 0.01), reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed reasoning framework.",2025-12-25

Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas.

Our approach infers unknown closure terms in the governing equations (gray-box discovery) under the assumption that the temporal derivative, convective transport, and pressure-gradient contributions are known. The formulation is rooted in a variational principle from nonequilibrium thermodynamics, where the dynamics is defined by a free-energy functional and a dissipation functional. The unknown constitutive terms arise as functional derivatives of these functionals with respect to the state variables. To enable a flexible and structured model discovery, the free-energy and dissipation functionals are parameterized using neural networks, while their functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation. This construction enforces thermodynamic consistency by design, ensuring monotonic decay of the total free energy and non-negative entropy production. The resulting method, termed GIMLET (Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics), avoids reliance on a predefined library of candidate functions, unlike sparse regression or symbolic identification approaches. The learned models are generalizable in that functionals identified from one dataset can be transferred to distinct datasets governed by the same underlying equations. Moreover, the inferred free-energy and dissipation functions provide direct physical interpretability of the learned dynamics. The framework is demonstrated on several benchmark systems, including the viscous Burgers equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.",2025-12-25

This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.",2025-12-25

Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions.

In contrast to continuous trait approaches, PRISM assigns distinct Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) based cognitive policies to multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, initialized via data-driven priors from large-scale social media datasets.

Research has so far mainly focused on evaluating output quality and productivity gains, leaving aside the developers' experience during the interaction. In this study, we take a multimodal, developer-centered approach to gain insights into how professional developers experience the interaction with Generative AI (GenAI) in their natural work environment in a firm. The aim of this paper is (1) to demonstrate a feasible mixed-method study design with controlled and uncontrolled study periods within a firm setting, (2) to give first insights from complementary behavioral and subjective experience data on developers' interaction with GitHub Copilot and (3) to compare the impact of interaction types (no Copilot use, in-code suggestions, chat prompts or both in-code suggestions and chat prompts) on efficiency, accuracy and perceived workload whilst working on different task categories. Results of the controlled sessions in this study indicate that moderate use of either in-code suggestions or chat prompts improves efficiency (task duration) and reduces perceived workload compared to not using Copilot, while excessive or combined use lessens these benefits. Accuracy (task completion) profits from chat interaction. In general, subjective perception of workload aligns with objective behavioral data in this study. During the uncontrolled period of the study, both higher cognitive load and productivity were perceived when interacting with AI during everyday working tasks.

While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.",2025-12-25

Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.",2025-12-25

These species act as atomic fingerprints, revealing the thermodynamic constraints that shape material structure and composition. Herein, we combine transmission electron microscopy and atom probe of tellurium (Te) inclusions within cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) single crystals. The correlative analysis uncovers nanoscale precipitates embedded within Te inclusions, consisting of CZT nanocrystals with a Zn content of 1.5 at.%. Surrounding these precipitates, an around 10 nm-thick shell is observed, enriched with copper and indium impurities. In addition, traces of sodium and sulfur are detected within the nanocrystals. These findings provide direct evidence of the complex segregation and precipitation processes occurring during CZT crystal growth, reflecting the interplay of thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic constraints that govern solute redistribution. The resulting insights contribute to a deeper understanding of impurity behavior and phase separation mechanisms in CZT alloys. This work establishes a framework for modeling and optimization of growth strategies of higher-quality CZT crystals for next-generation infrared and radiation detection technologies.",2025-12-25

An auxiliary field regularizes the Sadowsky narrow-strip model to allow nonzero twist with vanishing curvature. The energy exhibits the scalings derived by Freddi and co-workers, and for a certain choice of parameter, convexifies the Sadowsky energy without patching. We present the kinematics and energetics of the model, and employ a variational approach featuring a rotation tensor to derive equilibrium equations. We perform a regular perturbation expansion to study the model behavior close to inflection points. When the energy is convex, curvature and moment are continuous at inflection points, while the auxiliary function suffers a jump, leading to a discontinuity in the ruled embedding for any finite width.",2025-12-25

Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19864v1,HARMON-E: Hierarchical Agentic Reasoning for Multimodal Oncology Notes to Extract Structured Data,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale",2025-12-25

In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.",2025-12-25

We focus on the one-dimensional case that can be studied using bosonization and in which the electron bulk is described by a Luttinger liquid. The impurity spins interact with the electrons via magnetic exchange that introduces the possibility of Kondo and RKKY physics. We find that for two special values of the interactions, the model can be refermionized as a non-interacting electron band hybridized with a regular array of resonant levels. These solvable limits provide access to impurity correlators that correspond to either extended algebraic order or local screening. A physical picture emerges of how the interelectron interactions can stabilize either Kondo or RKKY physics depending on the sign of the interaction.",2025-12-25

This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented, multi-agent framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and collaborative multi-agent reasoning for WiP prediction. The narrative generation component transforms structured event logs into semantically rich natural language stories, which are embedded into a semantic vector-based process memory to facilitate dynamic retrieval of historical context during inference. The framework includes predictor agents that independently leverage retrieved historical contexts and a decision-making assistant agent that extracts high-level descriptive signals from recent events. A fusion agent then synthesizes predictions using ReAct-style reasoning over agent outputs and retrieved narratives. We evaluate our framework on two real-world benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed retrieval-augmented multi-agent approach achieves competitive prediction accuracy, obtaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.50\% on one dataset, and surpassing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and persistence baselines. The results highlight improved robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating retrieval mechanisms and multi-agent reasoning in WiP prediction.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19833v1,Universal Seesaw Leptogenesis,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: We study the implications for leptogenesis in a class of left-right symmetric model, where all fermion masses are induced through the Universal Seesaw mechanism. Unlike conventional analyses, we do not use the decays of the neutrino embedded in the right-chiral lepton doublet, but rather those of the gauge-singlet mediators required for neutrino mass generation in the canonical Type-I seesaw. Due to the generalized parity symmetry that doubles the fermionic degrees of freedom in this model, we can generate the required $CP$ violation in the heavy fermion decays with only a single generation of mediators. One of the distinct features of our scenario is that the bounds from thermalization or washout via gauge interactions typically encountered in the canonical left-right symmetric models do not apply here. Moreover, the heavy mediators can decay to both the left and the right-chiral neutrinos, leading to a cancellation in the resulting baryon asymmetry for decays above the left-right symmetry breaking scale. We discuss ways to avoid this cancellation and show that low scale left-right symmetry breaking above the current collider limits is viable. The right chiral neutrinos also obtain their masses from the seesaw mechanism, and the lightest one turns out to have a sub-eV scale mass. We find that its abundance is consistent with standard cosmology, and it acts as potentially observable dark radiation.",2025-12-25

These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap. We furthermore report optimised structures of H1 cavities, and provide the optimisation code for widespread use.",2025-12-25

This paper presents a collective student model, which is built from past student logs. These logs are firstly grouped into clusters. Then an extended automaton is created for each cluster based on the sequences of events found in the cluster logs. The main objective of this model is to predict the actions of new students for improving the tutoring feedback provided by an intelligent tutoring system. The proposed model has been validated using student logs collected in a 3D virtual laboratory for teaching biotechnology. As a result of this validation, we concluded that the model can provide reasonably good predictions and can support tutoring feedback that is better adapted to each student type.",2025-12-25

However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks.

Conversely, we show that these special scalar alignments are perturbed when additional Lagrangian operators (e.g. renormalizable, multi-flavon operators and/or effective, higher-dimensional operators) are present that break said residual symmetry, leading to a vacuum reorientation and phenomenological consequences. We therefore construct a one-to-one correspondence principle between broken residual symmetries and vacuum alignment corrections, providing a mechanism to identify (and correct) a subtle but persistent form of phenomenologically relevant fine-tuning embedded in -- but often ignored by -- most successful non-Abelian flavour models. We first establish this correspondence in a set of toy models based on the S4 permutation symmetry, and then apply the lessons learned to the more realistic A4 Altarelli-Feruglio and $Δ(27)$ Universal Texture Zero models.",2025-12-25

Built on PE, PE-AV makes several key contributions to extend representations to audio, and natively support joint embeddings across audio-video, audio-text, and video-text modalities. PE-AV's unified cross-modal embeddings enable novel tasks such as speech retrieval, and set a new state of the art across standard audio and video benchmarks. We unlock this by building a strong audiovisual data engine that synthesizes high-quality captions for O(100M) audio-video pairs, enabling large-scale supervision consistent across modalities. Our audio data includes speech, music, and general sound effects-avoiding single-domain limitations common in prior work. We exploit ten pairwise contrastive objectives, showing that scaling cross-modality and caption-type pairs strengthens alignment and improves zero-shot performance.

However, it is observed that the current thinking process during generation mainly focuses on the text consistency with the text prompt, ignoring the \textbf{visual context consistency} with the visual reference images during the multi-modal generation, e.g., multi-reference generation. The lack of such consistency results in the failure in maintaining key visual features (like human ID, object attribute, style). To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward. The experiments show that our method outperforms both zero-shot unified models and those with text CoTs in multi-modal generation, demonstrating higher visual context consistency.",2025-12-25

Existing benchmarks fall short of diagnosing this limitation: they either focus on overly simplified qualitative reasoning or rely on domain-specific indoor data, constrained by the lack of outdoor datasets with verifiable metric ground truth. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark built from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors. This dataset provides metrically precise 3D information, enabling the automatic generation of spatial reasoning questions that span a hierarchical spectrum--from qualitative relational reasoning to quantitative metric and kinematic understanding. Evaluations reveal that the performance gains observed in structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings. Further analysis using synthetic abnormal scenes and blinding tests confirms that current MLLMs depend heavily on linguistic priors instead of grounded visual reasoning. Our benchmark thus provides a principled platform for diagnosing these limitations and advancing physically grounded spatial intelligence.",2025-12-25

About 20 to 50 patent entries are embedded on each page, arranged in a double-column format and printed in Gothic and Roman fonts. The font and layout complexity of our primary source material suggests to us that multimodal LLMs are a paradigm shift in how datasets are constructed in economic history. We open-source our benchmarking and patent datasets as well as our LLM-based data pipeline, which can be easily adapted to other image corpora using LLM-assisted coding tools, lowering the barriers for less technical researchers.

Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO.",2025-12-25

To address this issue, we propose CORE, an offline RL framework specifically designed for wireless environments. CORE identifies latent expert trajectories from noisy datasets via behavior embedding clustering, and trains a conditional variational autoencoder with a contrastive objective to separate expert and non-expert behaviors in latent space. Based on the learned representations, CORE constructs compensable rewards that reflect expert-likelihood, effectively guiding policy learning under limited or imperfect supervision. More broadly, this work represents one of the early systematic explorations of offline RL in wireless networking, where prior adoption remains limited. Beyond introducing offline RL techniques to this domain, we further examine intrinsic wireless data characteristics and develop a domain-aligned algorithm that explicitly accounts for their structural properties. While offline RL has not yet been fully established as a standard methodology in the wireless community, our study aims to provide foundational insights and empirical evidence to support its broader acceptance.",2025-12-25

The resulting structure on $UT_q(n)$ is neither commutative nor cocommutative, so we obtain a quantum group. The motivation comes from the idea of quantizing the incidence algebra of a finite poset, as the latter can be embedded as a subalgebra of the algebra of upper triangular matrices. After defining the bialgebra $T_q(n)$ and the Hopf algebra $UT_q(n)$, we study and compare their Lie algebras of derivations, their automorphism groups and their low degree Hochschild cohomology, in case $n=2$.",2025-12-25

While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.",2025-12-25

While supervised learning approaches dominate this field, the scarcity and high cost of annotated data for new domains present significant barriers. We argue that leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot setting is a practical alternative where resources for data annotation are limited. In this work, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique that utilises an intermediate Unified Meaning Representation (UMR) to structure the reasoning process for the ACSA task. We evaluate this UMR-based approach against a standard CoT baseline across three models (Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini-2.5-Pro) and four diverse datasets. Our findings suggest that UMR effectiveness may be model-dependent. Whilst preliminary results indicate comparable performance for mid-sized models such as Qwen3-8B, these observations warrant further investigation, particularly regarding the potential applicability to smaller model architectures. Further research is required to establish the generalisability of these findings across different model scales.",2025-12-25

The pattern of global symmetry breaking yields, as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNGB) bosons, both a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs and the link field whose vacuum expectation value breaks the flavour non-universal gauge group down to the SM. Inevitably, a third pNGB appears, transforming as a second Higgs doublet coupled only to the light generations. This heavy Higgs naturally mediates suppressed light Yukawa couplings, providing a solution to the flavour puzzle. At the same time, new physics contributions to flavour violating observables are CKM- and chirally suppressed, while electric dipole moment bounds are evaded through an automatic mass alignment in the light fermion sector. The result is a natural framework for addressing the origin of both Higgs and flavour hierarchies, with reduced Higgs mass tuning and minimised impact in flavour observables, that is best tested by high-$p_T$ and precision electroweak measurements.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19609v1,MapTrace: Scalable Data Generation for Route Tracing on Maps,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: While Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved human-like performance on many visual and textual reasoning tasks, their proficiency in fine-grained spatial understanding, such as route tracing on maps remains limited. Unlike humans, who can quickly learn to parse and navigate maps, current models often fail to respect fundamental path constraints, in part due to the prohibitive cost and difficulty of collecting large-scale, pixel-accurate path annotations. To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW). These gains highlight that fine-grained spatial reasoning, absent in pretrained models, can be explicitly taught with synthetic supervision.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19605v1,KerJEPA: Kernel Discrepancies for Euclidean Self-Supervised Learning,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: Recent breakthroughs in self-supervised Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) have established that regularizing Euclidean representations toward isotropic Gaussian priors yields provable gains in training stability and downstream generalization. We introduce a new, flexible family of KerJEPAs, self-supervised learning algorithms with kernel-based regularizers. One instance of this family corresponds to the recently-introduced LeJEPA Epps-Pulley regularizer which approximates a sliced maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with a Gaussian prior and Gaussian kernel. By expanding the class of viable kernels and priors and computing the closed-form high-dimensional limit of sliced MMDs, we develop alternative KerJEPAs with a number of favorable properties including improved training stability and design flexibility.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19602v1,No Data? No Problem: Robust Vision-Tabular Learning with Missing Values,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: Large-scale medical biobanks provide imaging data complemented by extensive tabular information, such as demographics or clinical measurements. However, this abundance of tabular attributes does not reflect real-world datasets, where only a subset of attributes may be available. This discrepancy calls for methods that can leverage all the tabular data during training while remaining robust to missing values at inference. To address this challenge, we propose RoVTL (Robust Vision-Tabular Learning), a framework designed to handle any level of tabular data availability, from 0% to 100%. RoVTL comprises two key stages: contrastive pretraining, where we introduce tabular attribute missingness as data augmentation to promote robustness, and downstream task tuning using a gated cross-attention module for multimodal fusion. During fine-tuning, we employ a novel Tabular More vs. Fewer loss that ranks performance based on the amount of available tabular data. Combined with disentangled gradient learning, this enables consistent performance across all tabular data completeness scenarios. We evaluate RoVTL on cardiac MRI scans from the UK Biobank, demonstrating superior robustness to missing tabular data compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RoVTL successfully generalizes to an external cardiac MRI dataset for multimodal disease classification, and extends to the natural images domain, achieving robust performance on a car advertisements dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/marteczkah/RoVTL.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19585v1,Increasing the Thinking Budget is Not All You Need,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: Recently, a new wave of thinking-capable Large Language Models has emerged, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across a wide range of reasoning benchmarks. Early studies have begun to explore how the amount of compute in terms of the length of the reasoning process, the so-called thinking budget, impacts model performance. In this work, we propose a systematic investigation of the thinking budget as a key parameter, examining its interaction with various configurations such as self-consistency, reflection, and others. Our goal is to provide an informative, balanced comparison framework that considers both performance outcomes and computational cost. Among our findings, we discovered that simply increasing the thinking budget is not the most effective use of compute. More accurate responses can instead be achieved through alternative configurations, such as self-consistency and self-reflection.",2025-12-25
arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19577v1,Deep Learning for Primordial $B$-mode Extraction,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.",2025-12-25
