However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines.

While prior studies have revealed significant layer redundancy in LLMs for generative tasks, it remains unclear whether similar redundancy exists when these models are adapted for retrieval tasks, which require encoding entire sequences into fixed representations rather than generating tokens iteratively. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of layer redundancy in LLM-based dense retrievers. We find that, in contrast to generative settings, MLP layers are substantially more prunable, while attention layers remain critical for semantic aggregation. Building on this insight, we propose EffiR, a framework for developing efficient retrievers that performs large-scale MLP compression through a coarse-to-fine strategy (coarse-grained depth reduction followed by fine-grained width reduction), combined with retrieval-specific fine-tuning.

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling.

Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold.

During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term ""internal RL"", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails.

The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity.

Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.",2025-12-25,discard,0.8,"This is a domain-specific systems/mission-engineering RL paper (digital mission model + agent-based simulation + PPO) demonstrated on aerial firefighting under perfect information, which is far from our core PE diligence and document/finance agent workflows.

The inclusion of Building Information Modeling (BIM) plays a central role in this shift, yet its influence on job satisfaction remains underexplored. In response, this study developed a human-centered measurement model for evaluating job satisfaction in BIM work environments by adapting Hackman and Oldham's Job Characteristics Model for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry to create a survey that captured industry perspectives on BIM use and job satisfaction. The model uses Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling to analyze the survey results and identify what dimensions of BIM-related work affect job satisfaction. While it was hypothesized that BIM use increases job satisfaction, the results show that only some dimensions of BIM use positively impact BIM job satisfaction; the use of BIM does not guarantee an increase in overall job satisfaction.

The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them.

We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration.

PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves.

A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.86,"This is directly relevant to Carlyle’s applied AI stack because it targets practical inference-cost reduction for Transformer LLMs via hybrid (softmax + linear) attention—useful for scaling diligence QnA, document analysis, and agent workflows.

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13.

Our main result is the significantly improved sample complexity for learning such low-degree polynomials. We show that, for any regression risk $\eps \in (0,1)$, a carefully designed two-layer NN with channel attention and finite width of $m \ge Θ({n^4 \log (2n/δ)}/{d^{2\ell_0}})$ trained by the vanilla gradient descent (GD) requires the lowest sample complexity of $n \asymp Θ(d^{\ell_0}/\eps)$ with probability $1-δ$ for every $δ\in (0,1)$, in contrast with the representative sample complexity $Θ\pth{d^{\ell_0} \max\set{\eps^{-2},\log d}}$, where $n$ is the training daata size. Moreover, such sample complexity is not improvable since the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the order $Θ(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$ with probability at least $1-δ$. On the other hand, the minimax optimal rate for the regression risk with a kernel of rank $Θ(d^{\ell_0})$ is $Θ(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$, so that the rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the network trained by GD is minimax optimal. The training of the two-layer NN with channel attention consists of two stages. In Stage 1, a provable learnable channel selection algorithm identifies the ground-truth channel number $\ell_0$ from the initial $L \ge \ell_0$ channels in the first-layer activation, with high probability. This learnable selection is achieved by an efficient one-step GD update on both layers, enabling feature learning for low-degree polynomial targets.

Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs.

The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature.

Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes.

Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks.

This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this ""too big to fail"" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse.

A central result in Bayesian nonparametrics is that under assumptions on the prior, the data-generating distribution (assuming a true frequentist model) and a semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ on the space of regression functions that satisfy the so called testing condition, the posterior contracts around the true distribution with respect to $ρ(.,.)$, and the rate of contraction can be estimated. In the regression setting, the semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ is often taken to be the Hellinger distance or the empirical $L^2$ norm (i.e., the $L^2$ norm with respect to the empirical distribution of the design) in the present regression context. However, extending contraction rates to the ``integrated"" $L^2$ norm usually requires more work, and has previously been done for instance under sufficient smoothness or boundedness assumptions, which may not necessarily hold. In this work we show that, for classes of priors based on random basis expansions or Gaussian processes with RKHS of Sobolev type and in the random design setting, such $L^2$ posterior contraction rates can be obtained under substantially weaker assumptions than those currently used in the literature. Importantly we do not require a known a priori upper bound on its supremum norm or that its smoothness is larger than $d/2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the covariates. Our proof crucially relies on an application of the matrix Bernstein concentration inequality to empirical inner product matrices, which require explicit upper bounds on the basis functions at hand that we prove in several cases of interest.

Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories.

This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.

Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images.

However, existing frameworks largely rely on unstructured natural-language reasoning and accumulate raw intermediate traces in the context, which often leads to unstable reasoning trajectories, context overflow, and degraded performance on complex multi-hop queries. In this study, we introduce Laser, a general framework for stabilizing and scaling agentic search. Laser defines a symbolic action protocol that organizes agent behaviors into three spaces: planning, task-solving, and retrospection. Each action is specified with explicit semantics and a deterministic execution format, enabling structured and logical reasoning processes and reliable action parsing. This design makes intermediate decisions interpretable and traceable, enhancing explicit retrospection and fine-grained control over reasoning trajectories. In coordination with parsable actions, Laser further maintains a compact context register that stores only essential states of the reasoning process, allowing the agent to reason over long horizons without uncontrolled context expansion.

These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary.

Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier.

However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.",2025-12-25,discard,0.84,"This paper focuses on classical computer-vision anomaly detection for quasi-periodic textured surfaces in manufacturing (texture basis + smooth/sparse decomposition).

Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative.

To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment.

We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries.

Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies",2025-12-25,discard,0.9,"This paper is focused on fault-tolerant packet routing for specialized hardware/network topologies (Gaussian Interconnected Networks) in NoC/WSN settings, which is largely orthogonal to our LLM/agent/RAG and PE diligence workflows.

It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques.

However, existing WM atlases are population-specific (adult or neonatal) and reside in separate spaces, preventing direct cross-population comparisons. A unified WM atlas spanning both neonates and adults is still lacking. In this study, we propose a neonatal/adult brain atlas (NABA), a WM tractography atlas built from dMRI data of both neonates and adults. NABA is constructed using a robust, data-driven fiber clustering pipeline, enabling group-wise WM atlasing across populations despite substantial anatomical variability. The atlas provides a standardized template for WM parcellation, allowing direct comparison of WM tracts between neonates and adults. Using NABA, we conduct four analyses: (1) evaluating the feasibility of joint WM mapping across populations, (2) characterizing WM development across neonatal ages relative to adults, (3) assessing sex-related differences in neonatal WM development, and (4) examining the effects of preterm birth. Our results show that NABA robustly identifies WM tracts in both populations. We observe rapid fractional anisotropy (FA) development in long-range association tracts, including the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus II, whereas intra-cerebellar tracts develop more slowly. Neonatal females exhibit faster overall FA development than males. Although preterm neonates show lower overall FA development rates, they demonstrate relatively higher FA growth in specific tracts, including the corticospinal tract, corona radiata-pontine pathway, and intracerebellar tracts.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20368v1,Avoiding the Price of Adaptivity: Inference in Linear Contextual Bandits via Stability,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Statistical inference in contextual bandits is complicated by the adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature of the data. A growing body of work has shown that classical least-squares inference may fail under adaptive sampling, and that constructing valid confidence intervals for linear functionals of the model parameter typically requires paying an unavoidable inflation of order $\sqrt{d \log T}$. This phenomenon -- often referred to as the price of adaptivity -- highlights the inherent difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies.
  A key structural property that circumvents this limitation is the \emph{stability} condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to concentrate around a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals -- designed for i.i.d. data -- become asymptotically valid even under adaptation, \emph{without} incurring the $\sqrt{d \log T}$ price of adaptivity.
  In this paper, we propose and analyze a penalized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method.

However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data.

The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling.

Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation.

Evaluating Multilingual Large Language Models on Reasoning Traditional Bangla Tricky Riddles,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20319v1,Deep Learning Classification of EEG Responses to Multi-Dimensional Transcranial Electrical Stimulation,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: A major shortcoming of medical practice is the lack of an objective measure of conscious level. Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG).
  Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses.
  In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks.

This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation.

Constraint solvers enforce structural and perceptual validity, but the rules they require are difficult to author and too rigid to capture situated design knowledge. Large language models require no formal rules and can reason about contextual nuance, but they prioritize popular conventions over empirically grounded best practices. We address this tension by proposing a cataloging scheme that structures visualization design knowledge as natural-language guidelines with semantically typed metadata. This allows experts to author knowledge that machines can query. An expert study ($N=18$) indicates that practitioners routinely adapt heuristics to situational factors such as audience and communicative intent. To capture this reasoning, guideline sections specify not only advice but also the contexts where it applies, exceptions that invalidate it, and the sources from which it derives. We demonstrate the scheme's expressiveness by cataloging 744 guidelines drawn from cognitive science, accessibility standards, data journalism, and research on rhetorical aspects of visual communication. We embed guideline sections in a vector space, opening the knowledge itself to structural analysis. This reveals conflicting advice across sources and transferable principles between domains.

CoxPH assumes constant hazard ratios, often failing to capture real-world dynamics, while traditional AFT models are limited by rigid distributional assumptions. Although deep learning models like DeepAFT address these constraints by improving predictive accuracy and handling censoring, they inherit the significant challenge of black-box interpretability. The recent introduction of CoxKAN demonstrated the successful integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a novel architecture that yields highly accurate and interpretable symbolic representations, within the CoxPH framework. Motivated by the interpretability gains of CoxKAN, we introduce KAN-AFT (Kolmogorov Arnold Network-based AFT), the first framework to apply KANs to the AFT model. KAN-AFT effectively models complex nonlinear relationships within the AFT framework. Our primary contributions include: (i) a principled AFT-KAN formulation, (ii) robust optimization strategies for right-censored observations (e.g., Buckley-James and IPCW), and (iii) an interpretability pipeline that converts the learned spline functions into closed-form symbolic equations for survival time.

We find that balancing solar and wind generation with pumped hydro energy storage eliminates the need for fossil gas without incurring a cost penalty.

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability.

This is computationally demanding, particularly, if solutions have to be computed across strongly varying parameter values, e.g., in real-time control or for model-based design. Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method.

To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows.

We investigate two classic scenarios proposed in the literature, namely, Friends Appreciation ($\mathsf{FA}$) and Enemies Aversion ($\mathsf{EA}$): in the former, each agent primarily cares about the number of friends in her coalition, breaking ties based on the number of enemies, while in the latter, the opposite is true. For $\mathsf{EA}$, we show that our objective is hard to approximate within $O(n^{1-ε})$, for any fixed $ε>0$, and provide a polynomial-time $(n-1)$-approximation. For $\mathsf{FA}$, we obtain an NP-hardness result and a polynomial-time approximation algorithm. Our algorithm achieves a ratio of $2-Θ(\frac{1}{n})$ when every agent has at least two friends; however, if some agent has at most one friend, its approximation ratio deteriorates to $n/2$. We recover the $2-Θ(\frac{1}{n})$ approximation ratio for two important variants: when randomization is allowed and when the friendship relationship is symmetric.

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks.

The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via ""Signal Consensus"" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth.

Participants engaged in a 15-minute interaction and subsequently evaluated their experience using subjective measures of empathy and interaction quality. Results from analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences across conditions in affective empathy, perceived naturalness of facial movement, and appropriateness of facial expression. The video-based empathic expression condition elicited significantly higher affective empathy than the neutral baseline (p < .001) and marginally higher levels than the dialogue-based condition (p < .10).

We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch.

We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods.

Designed to leverage quantitative techniques for enhanced risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies in volatile environments, the architecture employs FinBERT, a transformer-based NLP model, to extract sentiment from ESG texts, followed by unsupervised clustering (UMAP/HDBSCAN) to identify 5 latent ESG regimes, validated via PCA. These regimes are mapped to economic conditions using a dense neural network and gradient boosting classifier, achieving 84.04% training and 82.0% validation accuracy. Concurrently, time-series models (SRNN, MLP, LSTM, GRU) forecast daily closing prices, with GRU attaining an R-squared of 0.801 and LSTM delivering 52.78% directional accuracy on intraday data. A strong correlation between S&P SL20 and S&P 500, observed through moving average and volatility trend plots, further bolsters forecasting precision.

However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks.

As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines.

Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem.
  To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%.

To address this limitation, we present RESPOND, a structured decision-making framework for LLM-driven agents grounded in explicit risk patterns. RESPOND represents each ego-centric scene using a unified 5 by 3 matrix that encodes spatial topology and road constraints, enabling consistent and reliable retrieval of spatial risk configurations. Based on this representation, a hybrid rule and LLM decision pipeline is developed with a two-tier memory mechanism. In high-risk contexts, exact pattern matching enables rapid and safe reuse of verified actions, while in low-risk contexts, sub-pattern matching supports personalized driving style adaptation. In addition, a pattern-aware reflection mechanism abstracts tactical corrections from crash and near-miss frames to update structured memory, achieving one-crash-to-generalize learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RESPOND. In highway-env, RESPOND outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and reinforcement learning based driving agents while producing substantially fewer collisions. With step-wise human feedback, the agent acquires a Sporty driving style within approximately 20 decision steps through sub-pattern abstraction. For real-world validation, RESPOND is evaluated on 53 high-risk cut-in scenarios extracted from the HighD dataset. For each event, intervention is applied immediately before the cut-in and RESPOND re-decides the driving action.

They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions.

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback.

Hash technique has shown its superiority for speeding up the online recommendation by bit operations on Hamming distance computations. However, existing hashing-based recommendations suffer from low accuracy, especially with sparse settings, due to the limited representation capability of each bit and neglected inherent relations among users and items. To this end, this paper lodges a Collaborative Group-Aware Hashing (CGAH) method for both collaborative filtering (namely CGAH-CF) and content-aware recommendations (namely CGAH) by integrating the inherent group information to alleviate the sparse issue.

However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate. It exposes a fundamental blind spot in existing defenses, and calls for rethinking cross-modal security in MLLM-integrated systems.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.9,"This is highly relevant to production multimodal/document pipelines (PDFs with embedded images, screenshots, scanned docs) where hidden instructions or payloads could be introduced to manipulate agent behavior or bypass safety layers.

However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by ""adversarial instructions"" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase.

Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$.
  Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols. Specifically, the first efficient parity and congruence protocols introduced here use both $O(\log^3 n)$ states and achieve silent stabilisation in $O(\log^3 n)$ time. We conclude by discussing the impact of implicit conversion between unary and binary representations enabled by the weight system, with applications to other problems, including the computation and representation of (sub-)population sizes.",2025-12-25,discard,0.87,"This looks like a theoretical distributed-computing paper in the population-protocols model (finite-state anonymous agents with random pairwise interactions), focused on parity/congruence predicates and silent stabilization bounds.

The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU.

Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings.

Conventional rule-based metrics merely score programs based on their surface-level similarities with reference programs instead of analyzing functionality and code quality in depth. To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors. Others propose fine-grained but subjective, vaguely-defined evaluation criteria, introducing unreliability in manually-annotated scores, which is the ground-truth they rely on. Furthermore, they often use uncontrolled data synthesis methods, leading to unbalanced score distributions that poorly represent real-world code generation scenarios.
  To curate a diverse benchmark with programs of well-balanced distributions across various quality levels and streamline the manual annotation procedure, we propose AXIOM, a novel perturbation-based framework for synthesizing code evaluation benchmarks at scale. It reframes program scores as the refinement effort needed for deployment, consisting of two stages: (1) Rule-guided perturbation, which prompts LLMs to apply sequences of predefined perturbation rules to existing high-quality programs to modify their functionality and code quality, enabling us to precisely control each program's target score to achieve balanced score distributions.

However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation.

Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance.

Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets.

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks.

However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores.

Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success.

We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.88,"This is directly relevant to long-horizon agent workflows: it proposes a concrete “belief state” memory bottleneck in natural language that keeps context near-constant across many steps—highly applicable to diligence agents that must operate over long document/tool interaction traces.

Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines.

We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds.

To this end, we propose Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP), a new learning paradigm for rich-text graph representation learning. Besides considering similarity regarding structure and text, JSDMP further captures their corresponding dissimilarity by Jensen-Shannon divergence. Similarity and dissimilarity are then jointly used to compute new message weights among text nodes, thus enabling representations to learn with contextual and structural information from truly correlated text nodes. With JSDMP, we propose two novel graph neural networks, namely Divergent message-passing graph convolutional network (DMPGCN) and Divergent message-passing Page-Rank graph neural networks (DMPPRG), for learning representations in rich-text graphs. DMPGCN and DMPPRG have been extensively texted on well-established rich-text datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.

However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain.

In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies.

It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.

Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment.

Accurately predicting student engagement is essential for optimizing teaching strategies and providing personalized interventions. However, most approaches focus on single-dimensional feature analysis and assessing engagement based on individual student factors. In this work, we propose a dual-stream multi-feature fusion model based on hypergraph convolutional networks (DS-HGCN), incorporating social contagion of student engagement. DS-HGCN enables accurate prediction of student engagement states by modeling multi-dimensional features and their propagation mechanisms between students. The framework constructs a hypergraph structure to encode engagement contagion among students and captures the emotional and behavioral differences and commonalities by multi-frequency signals. Furthermore, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism to dynamically weigh the influence of each student, accounting for individual differences in the propagation process.

Our goal is two-fold: the first is to preserve the tensor structure when performing dimension reduction, particularly the meaning of the tensor modes, for improved interpretation; the second is to substantially reduce the number of parameters in dimension reduction, thereby achieving model parsimony and enhancing estimation accuracy. Our two tensor dimension reduction methods echo the two commonly used tensor decomposition mechanisms: one is the Tucker decomposition, which reduces a larger tensor to a smaller one; the other is the CP-decomposition, which represents an arbitrary tensor as a sequence of rank-one tensors. We developed the Fisher consistency of our methods at the population level and established their consistency and convergence rates. Both methods are easy to implement numerically: the Tucker-form can be implemented through a sequence of least-squares steps, and the CP-form can be implemented through a sequence of singular value decompositions.

Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive ""thinking"" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels.

Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction.

First, prior work has largely considered ad targeting and engagement metrics individually rather than in composition. This has resulted in privacy notions that, while reasonable for each protocol in isolation, fail to compose to a natural notion of privacy for the ecosystem as a whole, permitting advertisers to extract new information about the audience of their advertisements. The second issue serves to explain the first: we prove that \textit{perfect} privacy is impossible for any, even minimally, useful advertising ecosystem, due to the advertisers' expectation of conducting market research on the results.
  Having demonstrated that leakage is inherent in advertising, we re-examine what privacy could realistically mean in advertising, building on the well-established notion of \textit{sensitive} data in a specific context.

Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression.

To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens.

Review Rejected,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are now widely used in writing and reviewing scientific papers. While this trend accelerates publication growth and reduces human workload, it also introduces serious risks. Papers written or reviewed by LLMs may lack real novelty, contain fabricated or biased results, or mislead downstream research that others depend on. Such issues can damage reputations, waste resources, and even endanger lives when flawed studies influence medical or safety-critical systems. This research explores both the offensive and defensive sides of this growing threat. On the attack side, we demonstrate how an author can inject hidden prompts inside a PDF that secretly guide or ""jailbreak"" LLM reviewers into giving overly positive feedback and biased acceptance. On the defense side, we propose an ""inject-and-detect"" strategy for editors, where invisible trigger prompts are embedded into papers; if a review repeats or reacts to these triggers, it reveals that the review was generated by an LLM, not a human. This method turns prompt injections from vulnerability into a verification tool. We outline our design, expected model behaviors, and ethical safeguards for deployment.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20385v1,Generalized method of L-moment estimation for stationary and nonstationary extreme value models,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Precisely estimating out-of-sample upper quantiles is very important in risk assessment and in engineering practice for structural design to prevent a greater disaster. For this purpose, the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution has been broadly used. To estimate the parameters of GEV distribution, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and L-moment estimation (LME) methods have been primarily employed. For a better estimation using the MLE, several studies considered the generalized MLE (penalized likelihood or Bayesian) methods to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information for parameters. However, a generalized LME method for the same purpose has not been developed yet in the literature. We thus propose the generalized method of L-moment estimation (GLME) to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information. The proposed estimation is based on the generalized L-moment distance and a multivariate normal likelihood approximation. Because the L-moment estimator is more efficient and robust for small samples than the MLE, we reasonably expect the advantages of LME to continue to hold for GLME. The proposed method is applied to the stationary and nonstationary GEV models with two novel (data-adaptive) penalty functions to correct the bias of LME. A simulation study indicates that the biases of LME are considerably corrected by the GLME with slight increases in the standard error. Applications to US flood damage data and maximum rainfall at Phliu Agromet in Thailand illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method. This study may promote further work on penalized or Bayesian inferences based on L-moments.",2025-12-25,discard,0.9,"This is a traditional statistics paper on penalized L-moment estimation for stationary/nonstationary GEV extreme value models, with applications in hydrology/engineering risk.

However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.78,"Although it targets text-to-image generation (not a core PE diligence workflow), CRAFT’s structured, constraint-driven inference-time loop (decompose requirements → verify with a model → apply targeted edits → explicit stopping) is highly relevant to improving reliability/controllability of agentic multimodal systems more broadly.

For the underlying Ising model, this leads to the scaling limit of the energy-energy correlations and reveals a connection between the scaling limits of (near-)critical planar Ising models and quasiconformal mappings. For grids approximating bounded domains in the complex plane, we establish, in the scaling regime, the conformal covariance of the energy density on critical doubly periodic graphs. We complement this result with an analogous statement in the case where the limiting conformal structure generates a maximal surface $(z,\vartheta)$ in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{(2,1)}$. All scaling factors obtained are local and expressed in terms of the geometry of the embedding, even in situations where they vary drastically from one region to another.

At the same time, studies have identified potential defects in the generated code. Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate.
  This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags.

From the perspective of electronic system security, electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis (SCA) has recently gained significant prominence with the growth of resource-constrained, internet connected devices.

Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies.

However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features.

Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders.

Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework.

We solve the model analytically, develop a numerical scheme to validate the theoretical predictions, and provide tools that can be used in further studies. A rich variety of diffusion regimes emerges, which modify the intermediate-time behavior of the mean squared displacement.

This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems.",2025-12-25,discard,0.87,"This paper is primarily a wireless communications optimization work (joint embedded index coding + MIMO beamforming) framed as an NP-hard resource-allocation problem, with MARL used as an approximation method.

However, such capabilities are often overlooked by existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation.

We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable ""embodiment-anchored"" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots.

An Examination on the Effect of Higher Diligence Calculations of the Sound Shell Model,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: The gravitational wave spectrum arising from using the full velocity profile is well known to differ qualitatively from analytic fits to a broken power law. Former studies have shown that unlike the uncertainties arising from thermal field theory, more diligence in the hydrodynamics can sometimes have limited benefit. However, this was shown in the context of broken power law fits. We test the benefits of some recent calculations in modeling the spectrum, including new developments in adjustments of the low frequency tail to be consistent with causality, but we use the full velocity profile. We find the spectral shape information has a heightened sensitivity to the speed of sound which can be demonstrated analytically, however for our benchmark model this still results in a modest difference. The reason for a heightened sensitivity is because the velocity at the boundary is quite sensitive to the speed of sound, which in turn means a small change to the speed of sound can have a large change to the shape of the velocity profile. Furthermore, even modest changes in the product $ακ$ can make non-trivial changes to the shape around the peak. Finally, there are many points where adjusting the infrared behavior to be consistent with causality is affecting the spectrum near its peak. All this implies that the spectrum is sensitive to five thermal parameters rather than four which gives hope that an observation of a gravitational wave spectrum from a first order cosmological phase transition could eventually give even more information about the underlying microphysics responsible.",2025-12-25,discard,0.97,"This arXiv paper is about cosmological phase transitions and modeling gravitational-wave spectra via hydrodynamics/sound-shell physics.

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training.

To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios.

Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases.

In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring"" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail.

We address the fundamental challenge of establishing and maintaining quantum entanglement links between satellites operating in free space, where links are subject to both transmission losses and quantum memory decoherence. This paper presents a comprehensive Markov chain model with a state space defined by link storage age and physical distance for analyzing entanglement distribution in noisy dynamic LEO satellite quantum networks. We construct transition matrices that capture system dynamics under varying request arrival rates, and derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including request satisfaction rate, average waiting time, link utilization efficiency, and average consumed link fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the critical trade-offs of higher request rates lead to faster link consumption with higher fidelity but potentially lower satisfaction rates, while lower request rates allow longer storage times at the cost of lower fidelity of increased decoherence effect.

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space.

To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination.

Personalizing Vision-Language-Action Models with Visual Attentive Prompting,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as ""bring my cup"", where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.64,"Although the paper is framed around robotics/Vision-Language-Action models (not our core PE workflow), the core contribution—training-free instance-level visual grounding from a few reference images using open-vocabulary detection + embedding matching, then injecting the grounding via visual prompts/instruction rewriting—looks transferable to practical enterprise multimodal systems.

Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process.

In recent years, Android graph-based deep learning research has proposed many approaches to extract relationships from applications as graphs to generate graph embeddings. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based classifier to generate API graph embeddings. The graph embeddings are combined with Permission and Intent features to train multiple machine learning and deep learning models for Android malware detection. The proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of 98.33 percent on the CICMaldroid dataset and 98.68 percent on the Drebin dataset.

Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts.

However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline.

Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals.

Structure-based MRSs have achieved state-of-the-art performance by constructing semantic item graphs, which explicitly model relationships between items based on modality feature similarity. However, such semantic item graphs are often noisy due to 1) inherent noise in multimodal information and 2) misalignment between item semantics and user-item co-occurrence relationships, which introduces false links and leads to suboptimal recommendations. To address this challenge, we propose Item Graph Diffusion for Multimodal Recommendation (IGDMRec), a novel method that leverages a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to denoise the semantic item graph by integrating user behavioral information. Specifically, IGDMRec introduces a Behavior-conditioned Graph Diffusion (BGD) module, incorporating interaction data as conditioning information to guide the denoising of the semantic item graph. Additionally, a Conditional Denoising Network (CD-Net) is designed to implement the denoising process with manageable complexity.

Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning.

Any explanation invoked to explain LyC escape must agree with this dramatic cosmic evolution. Galaxy mergers are often suggested as such a regulating mechanism. They occur an order or magnitude more frequently at $z \ge 3$ than in the local Universe, and they can trigger LyC escape either by inducing strong nuclear starbursts, or by tidally displacing the neutral ISM from the bulk of the stars. In the local Universe, LyC escape has been found to correlate with a range of physical and observable properties closely associated with strong star formation. For this reason, interest in mergers as drivers of LyC escape have been mainly focused on their capacity to induce strong star formation. However, at $z \ge 2$, these correlations are weaker, and we observe a much more diverse Lyman Continuum Emitter (LCE) population. This suggests that processes external to the LCE galaxies are more important for facilitating the escape at higher redshifts, which makes tidal displacement an interesting explanatory model; however, this has only been conclusively observed once before. In this letter, we present archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU and HST UVIS and IR imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum emitter LACES104037. We find that its Lyman-Continuum escape originates in a tidal bridge in the direction towards an interacting companion galaxy first identified in this work.

To address this limitation, we propose a binary-free, architecture-agnostic solution that estimates the likelihood of conceptual zero-day vulnerabilities using only high-level descriptors. The approach integrates a tri-LLM reasoning architecture combining a LLaMA-based configuration interpreter, a DeepSeek-based structural abstraction analyzer, and a GPT-4o semantic fusion model.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19936v1,GIMLET: Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: We develop a data-driven framework for discovering constitutive relations in models of fluid flow and scalar transport. Our approach infers unknown closure terms in the governing equations (gray-box discovery) under the assumption that the temporal derivative, convective transport, and pressure-gradient contributions are known. The formulation is rooted in a variational principle from nonequilibrium thermodynamics, where the dynamics is defined by a free-energy functional and a dissipation functional. The unknown constitutive terms arise as functional derivatives of these functionals with respect to the state variables. To enable a flexible and structured model discovery, the free-energy and dissipation functionals are parameterized using neural networks, while their functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation. This construction enforces thermodynamic consistency by design, ensuring monotonic decay of the total free energy and non-negative entropy production. The resulting method, termed GIMLET (Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics), avoids reliance on a predefined library of candidate functions, unlike sparse regression or symbolic identification approaches.

This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.78,"This is directly relevant to financial ML deployments in nonstationary environments and proposes an actionable, regime-aware robustness evaluation framework that could be adapted into model risk/stress-testing pipelines for underwriting, fraud, or portfolio monitoring models.

Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions.

The aim of this paper is (1) to demonstrate a feasible mixed-method study design with controlled and uncontrolled study periods within a firm setting, (2) to give first insights from complementary behavioral and subjective experience data on developers' interaction with GitHub Copilot and (3) to compare the impact of interaction types (no Copilot use, in-code suggestions, chat prompts or both in-code suggestions and chat prompts) on efficiency, accuracy and perceived workload whilst working on different task categories. Results of the controlled sessions in this study indicate that moderate use of either in-code suggestions or chat prompts improves efficiency (task duration) and reduces perceived workload compared to not using Copilot, while excessive or combined use lessens these benefits. Accuracy (task completion) profits from chat interaction. In general, subjective perception of workload aligns with objective behavioral data in this study.

While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME).

Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS).

Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95.

In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.

Unlike conventional analyses, we do not use the decays of the neutrino embedded in the right-chiral lepton doublet, but rather those of the gauge-singlet mediators required for neutrino mass generation in the canonical Type-I seesaw. Due to the generalized parity symmetry that doubles the fermionic degrees of freedom in this model, we can generate the required $CP$ violation in the heavy fermion decays with only a single generation of mediators. One of the distinct features of our scenario is that the bounds from thermalization or washout via gauge interactions typically encountered in the canonical left-right symmetric models do not apply here. Moreover, the heavy mediators can decay to both the left and the right-chiral neutrinos, leading to a cancellation in the resulting baryon asymmetry for decays above the left-right symmetry breaking scale. We discuss ways to avoid this cancellation and show that low scale left-right symmetry breaking above the current collider limits is viable.

These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging.

However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks.

Conversely, we show that these special scalar alignments are perturbed when additional Lagrangian operators (e.g. renormalizable, multi-flavon operators and/or effective, higher-dimensional operators) are present that break said residual symmetry, leading to a vacuum reorientation and phenomenological consequences. We therefore construct a one-to-one correspondence principle between broken residual symmetries and vacuum alignment corrections, providing a mechanism to identify (and correct) a subtle but persistent form of phenomenologically relevant fine-tuning embedded in -- but often ignored by -- most successful non-Abelian flavour models.

PE-AV's unified cross-modal embeddings enable novel tasks such as speech retrieval, and set a new state of the art across standard audio and video benchmarks.

However, it is observed that the current thinking process during generation mainly focuses on the text consistency with the text prompt, ignoring the \textbf{visual context consistency} with the visual reference images during the multi-modal generation, e.g., multi-reference generation. The lack of such consistency results in the failure in maintaining key visual features (like human ID, object attribute, style). To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward.

Existing benchmarks fall short of diagnosing this limitation: they either focus on overly simplified qualitative reasoning or rely on domain-specific indoor data, constrained by the lack of outdoor datasets with verifiable metric ground truth. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark built from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors. This dataset provides metrically precise 3D information, enabling the automatic generation of spatial reasoning questions that span a hierarchical spectrum--from qualitative relational reasoning to quantitative metric and kinematic understanding. Evaluations reveal that the performance gains observed in structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings.

Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training.

To address this issue, we propose CORE, an offline RL framework specifically designed for wireless environments. CORE identifies latent expert trajectories from noisy datasets via behavior embedding clustering, and trains a conditional variational autoencoder with a contrastive objective to separate expert and non-expert behaviors in latent space. Based on the learned representations, CORE constructs compensable rewards that reflect expert-likelihood, effectively guiding policy learning under limited or imperfect supervision. More broadly, this work represents one of the early systematic explorations of offline RL in wireless networking, where prior adoption remains limited. Beyond introducing offline RL techniques to this domain, we further examine intrinsic wireless data characteristics and develop a domain-aligned algorithm that explicitly accounts for their structural properties.

While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP.

Unlike humans, who can quickly learn to parse and navigate maps, current models often fail to respect fundamental path constraints, in part due to the prohibitive cost and difficulty of collecting large-scale, pixel-accurate path annotations. To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW).

No Problem: Robust Vision-Tabular Learning with Missing Values,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: Large-scale medical biobanks provide imaging data complemented by extensive tabular information, such as demographics or clinical measurements. However, this abundance of tabular attributes does not reflect real-world datasets, where only a subset of attributes may be available. This discrepancy calls for methods that can leverage all the tabular data during training while remaining robust to missing values at inference. To address this challenge, we propose RoVTL (Robust Vision-Tabular Learning), a framework designed to handle any level of tabular data availability, from 0% to 100%. RoVTL comprises two key stages: contrastive pretraining, where we introduce tabular attribute missingness as data augmentation to promote robustness, and downstream task tuning using a gated cross-attention module for multimodal fusion. During fine-tuning, we employ a novel Tabular More vs. Fewer loss that ranks performance based on the amount of available tabular data. Combined with disentangled gradient learning, this enables consistent performance across all tabular data completeness scenarios. We evaluate RoVTL on cardiac MRI scans from the UK Biobank, demonstrating superior robustness to missing tabular data compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RoVTL successfully generalizes to an external cardiac MRI dataset for multimodal disease classification, and extends to the natural images domain, achieving robust performance on a car advertisements dataset.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19577v1,Deep Learning for Primordial $B$-mode Extraction,arXiv,2025-12-22,"Summary: The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation.

*   **Reasoning LLMs & Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** The text acknowledges the need for LLMs to reason and mentions **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting as a technique to elicit more thoughtful responses, contrasting it with a simple, incorrect answer.
*   **MCTS for Language Models (Planning with LLMs):** The core of the framework uses **MCTS** as the environment dynamics manager. The LLM acts as the agent, making decisions (actions like ""Retrieve"" or ""Answer"") at each node of the MCTS tree. This iterative exploration allows the agent to foresee consequences and refine its decision-making, similar to trial-and-error learning.
*   **Inference-time Compute & Test-time Scaling:** The MCTS process inherently involves iterative computation during inference (tree growth and simulation/rollouts) to determine the best sequence of actions, which relates to inference-time compute. The framework's flexibility allows for adjusting parameters governing the tree search, balancing speed and exploration.
*   **Hallucination Reduction and Detection/Grounding/Factuality:** While not explicitly using the terms ""hallucination reduction"" or ""detection,"" the framework addresses related issues:
    *   The MCTS approach is described as more **failure-tolerant** than CoT because it allows the LLM to explore multiple paths and **correct itself** if a path is derailed, unlike CoT where recovery from mistakes is difficult.
    *   The ""Retrieve"" action, which uses a vector database and a vision-language model to gather external evidence, serves to **ground** the LLM's response in external data, mitigating reliance solely on internal knowledge.
    *   However, the text explicitly states that **hallucinations and overconfidence persist as challenges** despite the advancements.

Tree search methods (ToT, RAP) often struggle with increasing complexity or tasks requiring self-verification, while CoT and SC perform well on arithmetic tasks. Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI's o1 show strong performance, especially in arithmetic and planning, but still struggle with tasks requiring advanced spatial reasoning (like Rubik's Cube). The research suggests a need for more diverse approaches beyond just scaling computation.

The provided webpage introduces **Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)**, a general framework that synergizes LLM capabilities in **reasoning, acting, and planning**.

Here is a summary of how LATS addresses the concepts in the query:

*   **Reasoning LLMs & Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** LATS builds upon and extends reasoning techniques like CoT by framing the problem as a search over possible reasoning and acting steps. It uses the base LLM ($p_\theta$) for reasoning.
*   **Planning with LLMs & MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search):** LATS's core contribution is integrating a variant of **MCTS** to enable deliberate planning, moving beyond the simple, reflexive acting processes of prior methods. This allows LATS to search over a combinatorial space of reasoning and acting steps.
*   **Self-Reflection:** LATS incorporates a **Reflection** operation. Upon reaching an unsuccessful terminal node, the LLM generates a verbal self-reflection summarizing errors, which is stored and used as additional context in future trials, enabling the agent to learn from trial and error without explicit training.
*   **Grounding & Factuality (and Hallucination Reduction):** LATS enhances sensibility and addresses limitations of purely internal reasoning (which risks hallucination) by incorporating **external feedback** (observations from the environment). The value function also incorporates a **self-consistency score** to improve value assignment.
*   **Inference-Time Compute & Test-Time Scaling:** LATS involves a higher computational cost than simpler prompting methods (like ReAct) because of the tree search. However, the paper notes that LATS achieves better performance and, in some comparisons, requires fewer overall nodes/tokens upon success than other tree-based search methods (like ToT and RAP), suggesting a more efficient search mechanism. The authors acknowledge the higher compute cost but expect it to decrease over time.

The provided webpage text introduces a framework called **Reasoning via Planning (RAP)**, which addresses limitations in current LLM reasoning, particularly the lack of an internal world model needed for deliberate planning.

Here is a summary of how the text relates to the query topics:

*   **Reasoning and Planning / Planning with LLMs:** The core of the paper is the RAP framework, which repurposes the LLM as both a **world model** (to predict future states) and a **reasoning agent** to perform strategic planning. This directly addresses the need for better planning capabilities in LLMs, contrasting with the purely autoregressive nature of methods like CoT.
*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** CoT is mentioned as a baseline method that generates reasoning steps sequentially but struggles with complex, multi-step problems because it lacks simulation capabilities. RAP is shown to significantly outperform CoT in plan generation and math reasoning tasks.
*   **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for Language Models:** RAP explicitly incorporates **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** as the principled planning algorithm to efficiently explore the vast reasoning space, balancing **exploration vs. exploitation** (a key aspect of inference-time compute/strategy).
*   **Self-Reflection:** The reward design in RAP includes **""Self-evaluation by the LLM,""** where the model criticizes its own reasoning step (""Is this reasoning step correct?""), using the resulting probability as a reward signal.
*   **Grounding and Factuality:** The introduction of the **world model** (which predicts the next state based on actions) helps LLMs produce a more **grounded and coherent inference** by simulating the environment's state, which is crucial for maintaining factuality in multi-step reasoning. In logical reasoning tasks, RAP achieves high proof accuracy, suggesting improved grounding in the provided facts and rules.
*   **Inference-time Compute / Test-time Scaling:** The use of MCTS inherently involves managing **inference-time compute** by iterating a set number of times (e.g., RAP(1

Key aspects related to your query:

*   **Reasoning LLMs & Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** RAP is presented as an improvement over the **chain-of-thought (CoT)** prompting baseline, showing superior performance, especially when many steps are required.
*   **Planning with LLMs & MCTS:** RAP achieves effective balance between exploration and exploitation by using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for language models. The document details modifications made to classic MCTS to handle the large reasoning space and high computational cost of LLMs, including sampling potential actions and using lightweight local rewards during selection.
*   **Inference-time compute & Test-time scaling:** The framework operates during the inference stage. The performance comparison against CoT shows that RAP maintains a high success rate where CoT drops significantly when more steps are needed, suggesting better scaling with reasoning depth.
*   **Self-reflection (Self-evaluation reward):** The framework utilizes a **self-evaluation reward** as part of its reward structure. Experiments show that the self-evaluation reward is crucial for guiding reasoning, especially in mathematical reasoning where detecting errors post-generation is feasible.
*   **Grounding & Hallucination Reduction:** While not explicitly using the terms ""grounding"" or ""hallucination reduction,"" the framework's use of an LLM as a **world model** to simulate states and anticipate outcomes, combined with planning, serves to structure the reasoning process, which is a method to improve factuality and reduce errors compared to simple CoT. The text also mentions the importance of grounding in future work (combining external tools).
*   **Reward Choice:** The effectiveness of different rewards (action likelihood, task-specific, self-evaluation) is explored, showing that combinations, particularly those including self-evaluation, boost performance across different tasks (Blocksworld and math reasoning).

 Do Reasoning Models Know When They Don’t Know?",Exa,2025-12-17,"The user query asks for a summary related to several topics concerning Reasoning LLMs, including chain-of-thought, inference-time compute, self-reflection, planning with LLMs, MCTS, test-time scaling, hallucination reduction/detection, grounding, and factuality.

The provided webpage focuses heavily on **Reasoning LLMs**, **chain-of-thought (CoT)**, **inference-time compute** (referred to as ""deeper reasoning"" or ""inference-time scaling""), **self-reflection** (introduced as ""introspective uncertainty quantification""), **hallucination reduction and detection** (addressed via uncertainty quantification and calibration), and **factuality** (assessed using benchmarks like SimpleQA).

Here is a summary of the key findings from the page relevant to the query:

**Reasoning LLMs and Chain-of-Thought (CoT):**
*   Reasoning language models (like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, and o3-Mini) achieve SOTA performance by using multi-step reasoning, often induced via reinforcement learning or CoT prompting.
*   The study investigates the calibration (trustworthiness) of these models when they self-verbalize their confidence.

**Inference-Time Compute / Deeper Reasoning (Test-Time Scaling):**
*   Deeper reasoning (scaling reasoning effort/tokens) generally leads to **higher accuracy**.
*   However, as accuracy saturates, deeper reasoning causes models to become **even more overconfident** (calibration errors increase, especially ECE), particularly on wrongly-answered questions.
*   Increased reasoning depth can also lead to a **decrease in the completion rate** as models struggle with format instructions.

**Self-Reflection (Introspective Uncertainty Quantification - IUQ):**
*   The paper introduces **Introspective Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ)**, where a model reasons about its own chain-of-thought trace to update its confidence, mimicking human self-checking.
*   More critical introspection (IUQ-Medium and IUQ-High, which explicitly ask the model to find flaws) generally **improves calibration** (reduces miscalibration/overconfidence) for models like o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1, especially on challenging datasets.
*   However, this introspection **degrades the calibration of Claude 3.7 Sonnet**.

The provided webpage focuses on the **calibration and uncertainty quantification (UQ)** of **reasoning models**.

Here is a summary of the relevant points from the text concerning the user's query topics:

*   **Reasoning LLMs & Calibration:** The paper examines the calibration of reasoning models, finding that they are generally **overconfident** and become even more so with deeper reasoning, especially when accuracy doesn't improve.
*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** The study explored CoT prompting alongside basic, multi-step, and top-K prompts. It found that **CoT prompting and multi-step prompting do not significantly outperform the basic prompt strategy** for reasoning models. This is because reasoning models are already trained to generate reasoning traces by default, unlike non-reasoning models where CoT is effective for eliciting reasoning.
*   **Self-Reflection (Introspection):** Critical introspection (a form of self-reflection) **enables models to identify flaws and hallucinations** in their reasoning traces, leading to improved calibration by reducing overconfidence (though Claude became more overconfident).
*   **Hallucination Reduction/Detection:** Introspection is shown to help models identify flaws and **hallucinations** in their reasoning traces, which aids in confidence reassessment.
*   **Planning with LLMs / MCTS:** While the paper discusses reasoning models and their traces, it does not explicitly detail planning with LLMs or the use of MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for language models.
*   **Factuality/Grounding:** The paper focuses on *confidence* calibration rather than explicitly measuring grounding or factuality, although improving calibration is related to reducing incorrect outputs (hallucinations).
*   **Inference-time Compute / Test-time Scaling:** These topics are not directly addressed, although introspection and multi-step prompting relate to increased inference-time computation.

**Summary relevant to the user query:**

The paper introduces **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting**, a technique that elicits **reasoning** in Large Language Models (LLMs) by including intermediate reasoning steps in few-shot examples.

*   **Reasoning LLMs & Chain-of-Thought:** CoT prompting guides LLMs to generate a ""chain of thought""—a series of short sentences mimicking a human reasoning process—before providing the final answer. This significantly improves performance on multi-step reasoning tasks like arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic manipulation, which large models often struggle with using standard prompting.
*   **Emergent Ability & Inference-Time Compute:** CoT reasoning was found to be an **emergent ability** tied to model scale; it only consistently improved performance for models larger than approximately 100 billion parameters. The increased output length implies increased **inference-time compute**.
*   **Hallucination Reduction and Detection (Factuality):** While CoT improves performance, the paper notes a limitation: there is **no guarantee that the generated chains of thought are factually correct or logically sound**, even if they lead to a correct answer. Manual analysis showed that errors in reasoning (major errors) and calculation/logic (minor errors) still occur, highlighting an open challenge in ensuring the **factuality** of the generated reasoning.
*   **Planning with LLMs:** The paper tested CoT on commonsense reasoning tasks like StrategyQA and SayCan robot **planning**, showing applicability beyond pure arithmetic.
*   **Grounding:** The paper does not explicitly discuss grounding in the context of external knowledge bases, but the manual analysis suggests that major errors stem from semantic understanding issues, which relates to how well the model grounds its reasoning in the problem's context.

**Topics not explicitly covered or detailed:**

Here is a summary of the page content relevant to your query:

**Reasoning and Planning with LLMs (Focusing on Latent CoT):**

*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Latent CoT:** The paper contrasts conventional explicit CoT (reasoning steps verbalized in natural language) with **Latent CoT**, where inference occurs in latent spaces, decoupling reasoning from language.
*   **Token-wise Strategies:** These methods use special tokens to streamline reasoning:
    *   **Discrete Tokens:** Symbolic markers (like ""pause tokens"" or ""planning tokens"") that segment or control internal computation.
    *   **Continuous Tokens:** Learned embeddings in latent spaces that represent intermediate reasoning states implicitly (e.g., COCONUT, CODI, SoftCoT).
*   **Internal Mechanisms:** These focus on how reasoning emerges implicitly within the model's structure or representations:
    *   **Structural CoT:** Uses architectural depth, recurrence, and looping computations (e.g., CoTFormer, Huginn, RELAY) to simulate iterative reasoning steps.
    *   **Representational CoT:** Internalizes explicit CoT directly into latent hidden states, often via knowledge distillation or fine-tuning (e.g., STaR, ICoT).

The paper addresses limitations of using standard MCTS with LLMs, specifically:
1.  The difficulty in obtaining **objective rewards** for tasks like question answering, unlike games like Go.
2.  The **excessive token usage and time consumption** required for statistically significant reward estimations (typically needing over 30 simulations).

MASTER uses LLM-specialized MCTS to coordinate agent recruitment and communication, autonomously adjusting the number of agents based on task complexity and ensuring focused communication. Experiments show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on HotpotQA (76% accuracy) and WebShop (80% accuracy).

Key aspects related to your query:

*   **Reasoning and Planning:** The core focus is on explaining decisions made by MCTS, a planning algorithm used in complex sequential planning problems.
*   **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for language models:** The framework is specifically designed to explain MCTS decisions.
*   **Grounding and Factuality:** The framework ensures that explanations are factually consistent with the underlying environmental dynamics and constraints by transforming user queries into logic statements that are evaluated against the MCTS search tree. The evaluation section explicitly measures **factual consistency** (using FactCC) and relevance (using BERTScore), showing significant improvement over using basic LLMs alone.
*   **LLMs:** LLMs are used in multiple components: interpreting user queries, generating logic statements, and generating the final natural language explanations.

The page does not explicitly detail concepts like ""chain-of-thought,"" ""inference-time compute,"" ""self-reflection,"" ""test-time scaling,"" or ""hallucination reduction and detection"" in the context of general LLM reasoning, but it addresses the need for **factuality** and **grounding** in explanations derived from a planning process.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.78,"This is directly relevant to agent reasoning/planning and hallucination mitigation: it proposes a concrete way to generate faithful natural-language explanations by grounding them in a logic layer evaluated against an MCTS search tree (useful for auditable agent traces and decision rationales in diligence/reporting workflows).

*   **Usage:** MCP-compliant clients (supporting Streamable HTTP) can connect to the Agent Server to use these exposed agents as tools. Examples are provided for connecting via Python (using `langchain-mcp-adapters`) and JavaScript/TypeScript.
*   **Exposing Agents as Tools:** Agents are exposed with their name, description, and input schema. It is recommended to define custom agents with explicit input/output schemas rather than relying on the general `AnyMessage` state.
*   **User-Scoped Tools:** Custom authentication middleware can be used to populate user context, allowing user-scoped MCP tools to be accessed within a LangSmith deployment.
*   **Limitations:** The current LangGraph MCP implementation **does not support sessions**; each `/mcp` request is stateless.
*   **Disabling MCP:** The endpoint can be disabled by setting `""disable_mcp"": true` in the configuration file.

    *   **Tool Use/Function Calling:** In the integrated architecture, **MCP servers essentially serve as the agent’s toolset**. The agent's logic (often implemented via LLM **function calling** abilities or an **agent framework**) decides when to invoke a server via standardized MCP API calls (which appear as function calls to the agent).

**Summary:**

The OpenAI Agents SDK defines an Agent as an LLM configured with instructions and tools. It supports **tool use** (function calling) and **structured outputs** via Pydantic models. Multi-agent systems can be designed using **manager/orchestration** patterns or **handoffs**. Agents maintain state and dependencies through a configurable **context** object.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.92,"This is official documentation for the OpenAI Agents SDK, directly relevant to our agent infrastructure work (tool/function calling, structured outputs, orchestration patterns like manager-as-tools and handoffs, and state/context injection).

Here is a summary of how the mentioned concepts relate to the frameworks discussed:

*   **Agent Frameworks:** The entire page is a comparison of agentic frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, OpenAI Swarm, LangChain).
*   **Tool Use/Function Calling:** All frameworks support **tool use**, which enables agents to call external APIs or functions. CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen use **structured functions** (often via annotations). OpenAI Swarm infers function behavior via **docstrings**. LangChain uses explicit interfaces.
*   **Agent Memory:**
    *   **LangGraph** supports in-thread (short-term) and cross-thread (long-term) memory.
    *   **CrewAI** provides layered memory out of the box, using ChromaDB and SQLite for short-term and long-term storage, and supports entity memory.
    *   **LangChain** supports both short-term (in-memory buffers) and long-term memory (integrating with external vector stores).
    *   **AutoGen** uses a contextual memory model for short-term context but lacks built-in persistent memory.
    *   **OpenAI Swarm** is stateless and does not manage memory natively.
*   **Agent Orchestration:**
    *   **LangGraph** excels at complex workflows using a **graph-based (DAG)** approach for fine-grained orchestration.
    *   **CrewAI** uses a role-based, declarative architecture, but its orchestration is limited to linear or loop-based flows.
    *   **LangChain** operates primarily through single-agent patterns, requiring manual orchestration for multi-agent setups.
    *   **AutoGen** uses free-form, asynchronous message passing for collaboration.
    *   **OpenAI Swarm** currently operates via a single-agent control loop using routines.
*   **Structured Outputs:** The page notes that most frameworks include built-in handling for **structured outputs** (e.g., JSON).

Key aspects of structured output:

*   **Implementation:** LangChain's prebuilt ReAct agent (`createAgent`) handles this automatically. The desired schema (Zod or JSON Schema) is set, and the resulting structured data is captured in the `structuredResponse` key of the agent's state.
*   **Response Format Control:** You can define the schema using a Zod schema or a JSON Schema.
*   **Strategy Selection:**
    *   **Provider Strategy:** Used when model providers (like OpenAI, Grok, Gemini) support native structured output via their APIs. This is the most reliable method.
    *   **Tool Calling Strategy:** Used for models that support tool calling but not native structured output. LangChain uses tool calling to enforce the structure.
*   **Customization:** You can customize the message content returned in the conversation history when structured output is generated using the `toolMessageContent` parameter.
*   **Error Handling:** LangChain provides intelligent retry mechanisms for common errors:
    *   **Multiple Structured Outputs Error:** If a model incorrectly calls multiple structured output tools when only one is expected, the agent provides error feedback and prompts a retry.
    *   **Schema Validation Error:** If the output does not match the expected schema (e.g., a rating outside the allowed range), the agent provides specific error feedback detailing the validation failure and retries.

agent_infrastructure,exa,https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/,Model context protocol (MCP),Exa,2016-06-09,"The webpage describes the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, an open standard that dictates how applications expose tools and context to language models, likened to a ""USB-C port for AI applications.""

The **OpenAI Agents SDK** understands multiple MCP transports, allowing agents to reuse existing MCP servers or build new ones to expose tools (like filesystem, HTTP, or connector-backed tools).

Key integration options discussed include:

1.  **Hosted MCP server tools (`HostedMCPTool`):** Tool execution is pushed into OpenAI's infrastructure via the Responses API. This supports streaming results, optional approval flows for sensitive operations, and integration with OpenAI connectors (e.g., Google Calendar).
2.  **Streamable HTTP MCP servers (`MCPServerStreamableHttp`):** For connecting to HTTP servers where the network connection is managed by the user, offering low latency.
3.  **HTTP with SSE MCP servers (`MCPServerSse`):** Similar to Streamable HTTP but specifically for servers implementing HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE).
4.  **stdio MCP servers (`MCPServerStdio`):** Used for local subprocesses, communicating over stdin/stdout, useful for quick proofs of concept.

The page also details features like **Tool filtering** (static or dynamic based on context) to control which tools are exposed, the ability for MCP servers to provide **dynamic prompts** to generate agent instructions, and **caching** of tool lists to reduce latency. Tracing is automatically captured for MCP activity.

**Regarding your query:**

The page focuses on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and its implementation within the **OpenAI Agents SDK** for providing tools and context to agents. It mentions concepts related to agent infrastructure like **tool use** and **function calling** (via MCP tools).

However, it **does not explicitly detail or define**:
*   **agent\_infrastructure** (as a general concept)
*   **agent memory** or **agentic memory**
*   **agent frameworks** (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents SDK, Anthropic Agents SDK, Google SDK are mentioned only in the context of the SDK being discussed or as potential external frameworks, but not defined or compared)
*   **structured outputs** (though tool results can have structured content, the general concept isn't the focus)
*   **agent orchestration**

agent_infrastructure,exa,https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/structured_outputs_multi_agent,Structured Outputs for Multi-Agent Systems,Exa,2025-03-15,"The webpage describes how to use **Structured Outputs** (enforcing a strict schema using the `strict: true` parameter, building on JSON mode and function calling) to build **multi-agent systems**.

The example demonstrates a four-agent system for a data analysis task:
1.  **Triaging agent:** Routes the user query to the relevant specialized agents.
2.  **Data pre-processing Agent:** Handles data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation using tools like `clean_data`.
3.  **Data Analysis Agent:** Performs statistical analysis using tools like `stat_analysis`.
4.  **Data Visualization Agent:** Creates charts using tools like `create_line_chart`.

The core benefit highlighted is that Structured Outputs guarantee that tool calls adhere to the provided schema, increasing robustness and reducing the need for manual argument validation.

**Regarding your specific query terms:**

*   **agent\_infrastructure:** The page details the setup of a multi-agent system, including agent roles and tool definitions.
*   **tool use, function calling, structured outputs:** These are the central themes of the cookbook.
*   **agent memory, agentic memory, agent frameworks, LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents SDK, Anthropic Agents SDK, Google SDK, agent orchestration:** These specific terms or frameworks are **not explicitly mentioned** in the provided text, although the concepts described (multi-agent systems, tool use) are foundational to these areas.
*   **MCP servers:** Not mentioned.

It details how to configure an agent to output data in a structured format, specifically JSON dictionaries, using various parsers like `MarkdownJsonDictParser` and `RegexTaggedContentParser`.

Key aspects covered include:
*   **Defining a Parser:** Using `content_hint` and `required_keys` to guide the LLM's output format.
*   **Parsing the Output:** Using the parser's `parse` method on a `ModelResponse` object to extract the structured data.
*   **Error Handling:** How the parser raises errors if the output does not match the expected format.
*   **Advanced Usage:** Using parsers for more complex content (like code snippets) via regular expressions, and **Auto Post-Processing** to automatically route parts of the parsed dictionary to agent memory (`keys_to_memory`), message content (`keys_to_content`), or metadata (`keys_to_metadata`).

The user query lists many topics related to agent infrastructure, frameworks, and SDKs (e.g., `agent_infrastructure: MCP servers`, `LangChain`, `agent memory`, `function calling`, `agent orchestration`).

**Summary relative to the query:**

The document specifically addresses **structured outputs** and **function calling** concepts by showing how to enforce structured responses from LLMs, which is a core component of modern agent frameworks. It also demonstrates how to route parts of the structured output to **agent memory** and message content.

However, the page **does not** discuss:
*   MCP servers
*   Tool use (beyond structured output for function-like responses)
*   Agent frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex
*   Specific SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

Here is a summary of how it relates to your query topics:

*   **Embeddings (new efficient models):** EmbeddingGemma is a new, efficient model with only **308M parameters** and a **2K context window**. It ranks as the highest text-only multilingual embedding model under 500M on the MTEB benchmark.
*   **Vector Databases / Retrieval:** The model is designed for retrieval tasks, using a Gemma3 transformer backbone modified with bi-directional attention (making it an encoder). It supports **Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL)**, allowing the 768-dimensional output vector to be truncated to 512, 256, or 128 dimensions for faster and cheaper downstream processing like similarity search in vector databases.
*   **RAG Architectures / RAG Alternatives:** The model is explicitly mentioned as unlocking new possibilities for **mobile RAG pipelines** and agents.
*   **Rerankers:** The model supports a specific prompt for **Reranking** tasks (`""Reranking"": ""task: search result | query: ""`).
*   **Hybrid Search:** Not explicitly mentioned, but the model's strong retrieval capabilities support the embedding component of hybrid search.
*   **Chunking Strategies:** Not explicitly mentioned, though the model has a 2048-token context window, which is relevant to chunking decisions in RAG.

The page also details extensive **Usage** instructions across various frameworks relevant to RAG pipelines, including **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **Haystack**, and **txtai**, and provides deployment options via **Text Embeddings Inference (TEI)**.

Key improvements and features mentioned include:
*   **Stronger Performance:** It outperforms all old embedding models on text search, code search, and sentence similarity tasks.
*   **Unification of Capabilities:** It merges five separate models into a single interface.
*   **Longer Context:** Context length increased from 2048 to 8192.
*   **Smaller Embedding Size:** New embeddings have 1536 dimensions, making them more cost-effective for **vector databases**.
*   **Reduced Price:** Priced 99.8% lower than the previous most capable model (Davinci) while achieving similar or better performance.

Here is a summary addressing the components of your query:

*   **Vector databases & Embeddings (new efficient models):** Traditional RAG uses embeddings (numeric vector representations of text) stored in a vector database for semantic search. The article notes limitations like semantic gaps, reduced accuracy, lack of interpretability, and high infrastructure costs associated with this method.
*   **Rerankers:** While not explicitly detailed as a separate section, the concept of improving retrieval accuracy is addressed. Some embedding-free methods, like lexical search followed by an LLM re-rank, are suggested as alternatives to purely vector-based ranking.
*   **RAG Architectures & RAG Alternatives:** The core of the article explores **RAG without embeddings**. Alternatives include:
    *   **Lexical or Keyword-Based Retrieval** (e.g., using BM25 against a full-text engine).
    *   **LLM-based Iterative Search** (e.g., ELITE), where the LLM guides the search process iteratively.
    *   **Structured Knowledge and Graph-Based Retrieval** (e.g., GraphRAG), which uses knowledge graphs to represent relationships between entities.
    *   **Prompt-Based Retrieval (Prompt-RAG)**, which uses the LLM to select relevant document sections based on a structured Table-of-Contents.
*   **Hybrid Search:** The future of RAG is predicted to involve **Hybrid & Adaptive Pipelines**, mixing fast vector search for common queries with fallback methods like graph or agent retrieval for complex reasoning tasks.
*   **Chunking Strategies:** The traditional method involves splitting documents into chunks before embedding. Embedding-free methods sometimes leverage document structure (like headings/TOCs) or utilize larger context windows to potentially reduce the reliance on explicit chunking strategies.

The main RAG alternatives covered are:

1.  **Prompt Engineering with Context Windows:** Injecting domain knowledge directly into the prompt using structured templates. This avoids external retrieval systems, leading to lower latency and complexity, but is limited by context window size and is not scalable for frequently updated knowledge.
2.  **Toolformer and API-Calling Models:** Allowing the language model to autonomously decide when to invoke external tools (like APIs, databases, or calculators) via function calling. This provides adaptive reasoning and improved response quality by pulling in precise, up-to-date information only when necessary.
3.  **LangChain Agents and Function-Calling Architectures:** Using agents as orchestrators to chain reasoning, information retrieval, and external tool execution in iterative loops. This is suitable for complex, multi-step workflows that require dynamic decision-making beyond simple similarity search.
4.  **Fine-tuning with Domain-Specific Data:** Directly training the model on curated, niche data. This is superior to RAG when responses must be highly consistent, deterministic, or when latency is critical, especially in narrow domains. Open-source tools like LoRA, PEFT, and Axolotl facilitate efficient fine-tuning.

The article also notes that the most lightweight alternative often involves combining simple retrieval mechanisms with advanced prompt engineering.",2025-12-25,discard,0.8,"While the topic (RAG alternatives: long-context prompting, tool/function calling, agents, fine-tuning) is directly relevant to our stack, the summary reads like a broad, SEO-style overview of well-known options rather than a substantive, implementable methodology or new empirical findings.

Here is a summary addressing the components mentioned in your query:

*   **Vector databases:** MODE **eliminates the need for dedicated vector databases** by replacing fine-grained vector search with a cluster-and-route mechanism.
*   **Embeddings (new efficient models):** The framework uses embeddings for initial chunking and for calculating cluster centroids, but the core efficiency gain comes from avoiding large-scale vector search over these embeddings during inference.
*   **Rerankers:** MODE **eliminates the need for re-rankers** entirely, as the cluster-and-route mechanism aims to provide highly topical context directly, reducing latency.
*   **RAG architectures:** MODE is presented as an **architectural alternative** to the standard ""index-retrieve-rerank"" pipeline.

Key points related to your query:

*   **RAG Architectures:** It focuses on a two-stage retrieval system where the first stage uses a fast **vector search** (relying on **embeddings**/bi-encoders) to retrieve a larger set of documents, and the second stage uses a slower but more accurate **reranker** to reorder and select the most relevant documents before passing them to the LLM.

*   **Embeddings & Chunking Strategies:** These are explicitly mentioned as part of the **Algorithm Configuration Space** (Table 1) that influences generation quality. Specifically, the choice of **embedding model** and **document chunking strategies** are tunable knobs.
*   **Rerankers & Hybrid Search:** **Result reranking** is listed as an algorithmic factor influencing quality. **Hybrid search** (combining vector search with keyword-based matching like BM25) is listed under the ""Retrieval method"" configuration.
*   **New efficient models & RAG alternatives:** While the paper acknowledges the continuous emergence of new retrieval techniques and models, it focuses on a framework (**RAG-Stack**) to evaluate them rather than introducing specific new models or alternatives to RAG itself.

**Summary of RAG-Stack's approach to these components:**

RAG-Stack addresses the complexity by systematically exploring the vast configuration space, which includes:

1.  **Algorithmic Factors (Quality-related):** Document chunking, choice of embedding models, Top-K, query rewriting, and result reranking.
2.  **System Factors (Performance-related):** Hardware choices (CPU/GPU), software frameworks, and database indexing/quantization.

The framework uses three pillars to manage this complexity:
*   **RAG-IR:** An abstraction layer that captures the performance-relevant attributes of the algorithm configuration (including chunking, embedding model parameters, Top-K, etc.) without capturing quality-only details.
*   **RAG-CM:** A cost model to predict system performance based on the RAG-IR representation.

This webpage excerpt focuses primarily on **Embeddings** and **Vector Databases** as a method for implementing memory in Large Language Models (LLMs), which is a core component of RAG.

Here is a summary of the relevant points covered in the text:

*   **Embeddings:** These are numerical representations (vectors) of words or text sequences that capture semantic meaning and relationships. The text discusses using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model. Similarity between embeddings is measured using **cosine similarity** (or cosine distance).
*   **Memory based on Embeddings (Basic RAG Concept):** Embeddings are used to implement memory by computing the embedding of user input and comparing it (using cosine distance) to pre-computed embeddings of stored data chunks to retrieve the most relevant context for the LLM prompt.
*   **Vector Databases:** For large datasets, iterating through all embeddings becomes slow.

retrieval_and_embeddings,exa,https://huggingface.co/blog/qdrddr/what-are-embeddings-and-vector-databases,What are Embeddings and Vector Databases?,Exa,2024-08-20,"The webpage explains **Embeddings** as numerical representations of information that allow computers to determine similarity for tasks like search and classification. These embeddings act like ""digital fingerprints"" (vectors) for data, enabling fast, semantic search by finding data points whose vectors are mathematically closest to the query's vector.

The text also covers:
*   **Vector Databases (Vector DB):** Where the encoded numerical representations (vectors) of a dataset are stored, allowing for quick retrieval of relevant information chunks, often as the first phase in a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** application.
*   **How Embeddings Models Work:** They are trained on large datasets to find correlations (e.g., recognizing that ""Pride and Prejudice"" is semantically related to ""First Impressions"").
*   **Why Use Embeddings:** It is faster and easier for computers to process and understand relationships numerically than by searching raw text directly.
*   **Advantages & Disadvantages:** A key advantage is simplifying initial data retrieval without needing a schema. A major disadvantage is the **lack of transitivity** (if A is similar to B, and B is similar to C, A is not necessarily similar to C) and difficulty in synthesizing summarized concepts over large datasets, which can lead to less than 100% accurate RAG results.
*   **Retrieval:** Vector database retrieval is presented as one method, and the text notes that vector search can be just the first step before using more complex techniques.

The query asks about **Vector databases, embeddings (new efficient models), rerankers, RAG architectures, RAG alternatives, hybrid search, chunking strategies**.

Here is a summary of the webpage content relevant to the user's query:

The paper systematically evaluates **GPT-4V** (including GPT-4o and vision preview) for **radiology report generation** using chest X-ray benchmarks (MIMIC CXR, CheXpert Plus, and IU X-Ray).

**Key Findings Related to the Query:**

*   **Vision-Language Models (GPT-4V) and Report Generation:** The study concludes that **GPT-4V cannot generate satisfactory radiology reports yet**, performing significantly worse than specialized state-of-the-art models across both lexical and clinical efficacy metrics, even with various prompting strategies (zero-shot, CoT, few-shot).
*   **Medical Image Reasoning:** The research decomposes the task and finds that GPT-4V performs poorly in the **medical image reasoning step** (predicting medical condition labels from images). Statistical tests suggest the model is not interpreting chest X-rays meaningfully, as its label predictions do not vary significantly based on the ground truth conditions present in the image.
*   **Report Synthesis:** Even when the image reasoning bottleneck is bypassed by providing **groundtruth conditions**, GPT-4V still underperforms a finetuned Llama-2 baseline in generating clinically accurate and well-written reports. Human evaluation confirmed that GPT-4V reports lacked diagnostic accuracy and completeness compared to the finetuned Llama-2 and groundtruth reports.
*   **Comparison to Other Models:** The paper notes that open-sourced models like Llama-3.2 vision perform similarly poorly to GPT-4V. The limitations section explicitly states that comparisons with other general-domain multimodal LMMs, including **Gemini** and **Claude vision**, are reserved for future research.

We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks.

These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients.

Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.
  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning.

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power.

We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher.

By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs.

However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization.

On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks,arXiv,2025-12-24,"Summary: The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform ""low-level"" tasks before ""high-level"" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup.

Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.82,"This is directly relevant to agentic workflows we run in PE (tool-using agents for diligence/Q&A/reporting), where repeated or near-duplicate user requests are common and latency/cost are material.

While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options.

By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine.

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a ""cross-task heterogeneity"" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima.

Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response.

These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora.
  To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.72,"Even though it’s framed as an industrial recommender-system paper, the core ideas—LLM-driven reasoning to enrich sparse/ID-based representations, multi-agent CoT distillation, and generative “beyond-log” behavior inference—map well to our needs in agentic enrichment, memory/representation learning, and forecasting from incomplete enterprise data.

Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently.

To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs.

We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance.

PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV.

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21208v1,Analytic and Variational Stability of Deep Learning Systems,arXiv,2025-12-24,"Summary: We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.68,"This is a very recent arXiv preprint that appears substantive (new unified stability framework + concrete corollaries like CFL-type conditions for ResNets and stability laws for SGD), which could translate into practical guidance for stable fine-tuning/training of in-house models (embeddings, rerankers, document models) and for diagnosing sensitivity/robustness issues.

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training.

However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments.

This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction.

Since risk attitudes at the end of the investment horizon are uncertain, terminal wealth is evaluated under a set of utility functions corresponding to all possible future preference states. These utilities are first converted into certainty equivalents at their respective levels of terminal risk aversion and then (nonlinearly) aggregated over the conditional distribution of future states, yielding an inherently time-inconsistent optimization criterion. We approach this problem by developing a general equilibrium framework for such state-dependent preferences and characterizing subgame-perfect equilibrium investment policies through an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system. This system gives rise to a coupled nonlinear partial integro-differential equation for the value functions associated with each state. We then specialize the model to a tractable constant relative risk aversion specification in which the preference factor follows an arithmetic Brownian motion. In this setting, the equilibrium policy admits a semi-explicit representation that decomposes into a standard myopic demand and a novel preference-hedging component that captures incentives to hedge against anticipated changes in risk aversion.

The methods scale well and have been used to find errors in a proposed industrial protocol. The key novelty is to use modal logic to capture a declarative, high-level representation of essential system properties -- the logical essence of the algorithm -- while abstracting away from transitions of an abstract machine that implements it. It is like the difference between specifying code in a functional or logic programming language, versus specifying code in an imperative one.

Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits.

This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep.

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions.

Building on a new fundamental theorem of asset pricing and a superhedging duality in this setting, we introduce a notion of bubble based on a novel definition of the fundamental price, and analyze their types and characterization. We show that two distinct types of bubbles arise, depending on the maturity structure of the asset. For assets with bounded maturity and no dividend payments, the $G$-supermartingale property of prices provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of bubbles. In contrast, when maturity is unbounded, the infi-supermartingale property yields a necessary condition, while the $G$-supermartingale property remains sufficient. Moreover, there is no bubble under a strengthened no dominance condition. As applications, we examine price bubbles for several standard contingent claims. We show that put-call parity generally fails for fundamental prices, whereas it holds for market prices under no dominance assumption. Furthermore, we establish bounds for the fundamental and market prices of American call options in terms of the corresponding European call prices, adjusted by the associated bubble components.",2025-12-25,discard,0.86,"This is a rigorous, theory-heavy mathematical finance paper (FTAP/superhedging duality, bubble characterization under model uncertainty and short-sale constraints) with no apparent connection to LLMs/agents, retrieval, or document-understanding workflows we’re deploying for PE due diligence.

In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.74,"Even though it doesn’t propose a new model, it offers a mechanistic, dynamical-systems-grounded explanation of when causal self-attention can/can’t represent certain time-series dynamics (e.g., softmax convexity leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory linear systems).

This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\in [n-1], k \in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $π^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $λ\mathbf 1\{S\times T\}$ where $S\subset [n], T\subset [d]$.

Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent.

Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21106v1,Semantic Refinement with LLMs for Graph Representations,arXiv,2025-12-24,"Summary: Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs.

This paper presents a systematic evidence synthesis and exploratory investigation of VOC-based affective computing using low-cost sensors. Study 1, a systematic scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, analyzed 16 studies from 610 records across breath, sweat, skin, and urine biosources. Evidence indicates that stress and affective states are reflected in VOC signatures (aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, sulfur compounds), though with considerable heterogeneity. Current research relies predominantly on laboratory-grade GC-MS or PTR-MS, while wearable sensors provide pattern-level outputs without compound-specific identification - a critical gap for practical systems. Study 2 (n=25) investigated whether low-cost TVOC sensors (BME688, ENS160) combined with physiological monitoring (HR, HRV, GSR) can detect laboratory-induced stress. Exploratory analysis revealed that high cardiovascular reactors exhibited elevated TVOC during arithmetic stress (d=1.38), though requiring replication in larger samples. Substantial interindividual variability emerged (CV>80%), with coupling patterns moderated by baseline emission levels and temporal lags of 30-80 seconds. Random Forest-based multimodal classification achieved 77.3% accuracy (5-fold CV). SHAP analysis indicated VOC sensors contributed 24.9% of model performance. Leave-one-subject-out validation yielded 65.3% accuracy, highlighting the need for individual calibration.

The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions.

With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity.

LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.74,"This is directly relevant to how we benchmark LLM/agent workflows when real human evaluation (or business “field tests”) is expensive/slow—persona simulation is a common shortcut, and the paper appears to formalize when that shortcut is actually valid.

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP.

This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan.

Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis.

This paper provides an insider's account of the sociotechnical friction that arises when an institutional goal of empowering non-technical staff conflicts with the technical limitations of enterprise Large Language Models (LLMs). Through analytic autoethnography, this study examines a GenAI project pushed to an impasse, focusing on a workaround developed to navigate not only technical constraints but also the combined challenge of organisational territoriality and assertions of positional power. Drawing upon Alter's (2014) theory of workarounds, the analysis interprets ""articulation work"" as a form of ""invisible labour"". By engaging with the Information Systems (IS) domains of user innovation and technology-in-practice, this study argues that such user-driven workarounds should be understood not as deviations, but as integral acts of sociotechnical integration. This integration, however, highlights the central paradoxes of modern GenAI where such workarounds for ""unfinished"" systems can simultaneously create unofficial ""shadow"" systems and obscure the crucial, yet invisible, sociotechnical labour involved. The findings suggest that the invisible labour required to integrate GenAI within complex organisational politics is an important, rather than peripheral, component of how it becomes functional in practice.",2025-12-25,discard,0.78,"This is primarily a qualitative/organizational autoethnography about sociotechnical friction, invisible labor, and institutional politics in higher education, rather than a technical advance in LLM reasoning, agents, RAG, or document understanding.

However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost.

This surge highlights the need to understand the nuances of student-AI interactions, especially those rare yet crucial. However, automated coding may struggle to capture these rare codes due to imbalanced data, while human coding remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. The current study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to approximate or replace humans in deductive, theory-driven coding, while also exploring how human-AI collaboration might support such coding tasks at scale. We compared the coding performance of small transformer classifiers (e.g., BERT) and LLMs in two datasets, with particular attention to imbalanced head-tail distributions in dialogue codes. Our results showed that LLMs did not outperform BERT-based models and exhibited systematic errors and biases in deductive coding tasks.

In addition, our model refines previous models according to the characteristics of medical problems and provides referable guidance for each step. These improvements make the visualization design targeted, generalizable, and operational, which can adapt to the complexity and diversity of medical problems.

The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity.

However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests.

However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks.

However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats.

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists.

However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each.

To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous.

This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%.

Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference.

However, classical BRL methods assume known forms of transition and reward models, reducing their applicability in real-world problems. As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises.

These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study.

The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.
  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs.

While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized ""spiky"" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing ""balanced"" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications.

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance.

In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces.

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary ""thinking tokens"" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model.

Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions.

However, the effective application of MLLMs to multimodal sequential recommendation remains unexplored: A) Existing methods primarily leverage the multimodal semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs to generate item embeddings or semantic IDs, thereby enhancing traditional recommendation models. These approaches generate item representations that exhibit limited interpretability, and pose challenges when transferring to language model-based recommendation systems.

Examples of such functions include Leontief, Cobb-Douglas, and linear production functions. Nevertheless, the conventional form of the CES production specification is still restrictive in multiple aspects. One example is the fact that the marginal effect of increasing input use always has to be to increase the variability of output quantity by the conventional construction of this function. This paper proposes a generalized variant of the CES production function that allows for various input effects on the probability distribution of output. Failure to allow for this possible input-output risk structure is indeed one of the limitations of the conventional form of the CES production function. This limitation may result in false inferences about input-driven output risk. In light of this, the present paper proposes a solution to this problem. First, it is shown that the familiar CES formulation suffers from very restrictive structural assumptions regarding risk considerations, and that such restrictions may lead to biased and inefficient estimates of production quantity and production risk. Following the general theme of Just and Pope's approach, a CES-based production-function specification that overcomes this shortcoming of the original CES production function is introduced, and a three-stage Nonlinear Least-Squares (NLS) estimation procedure for the estimation of the proposed functional form is presented.

However, remarkably, the results from all the three indirect MCL designs show that women typically exhibit lower degrees of PrRA than men, and this result is robust across different MCL designs. The paper also introduces an 'irrationality gap' as the difference between PaRA and PrRA and explores the size of the irrationality gap within either gender group, finding it larger and statistically significant for men, while smaller and statistically insignificant for women.
  Originality/value: This study is the first to distinguish between PaRA and PrRA in a gender comparison, using experimentally validated methods.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20908v1,Where Did This Sentence Come From? Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation,arXiv,2025-12-24,"Summary: Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation.

However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net.
  DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency.

Missing observations shift recommendations toward frequently interacted items, which reduces the diversity of the recommendation list. To alleviate this problem, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) is widely used and commonly models propensities based on a power-law function of item interaction frequency. However, we found that such power-law-based correction overly penalizes popular items and harms their recommendation performance. We address this issue by redefining the propensity score to allow broader item recommendation without excessively penalizing popular items. The proposed score is formulated by applying a sigmoid function to the logarithm of the item observation frequency, maintaining the simplicity of power-law scoring while allowing for more flexible adjustment. Furthermore, we incorporate the redefined propensity score into a linear autoencoder model, which tends to favor popular items, and evaluate its effectiveness.

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings.

Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance.

Adversarial threats aim to hinder the machine learning models from satisfying their objectives. They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information.

The core idea of \texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD.

This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology.

We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.84,"This is directly relevant to deploying “reasoning” LLMs in high-stakes PE workflows because it probes a concrete failure mode: models following surface-level semantic cues instead of robust symbolic logic, even on trivial arithmetic under remapped notation.

  But individual observations may often have distinct weights, and none of these measures are sensitive to such varying weights.
  We propose a new weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary classification as well as weighted versions of related multiclass measures. The weighted MCC varies between $-1$ and $1$. But crucially, the weighted MCC values are higher for classifiers that perform better on highly weighted observations, and hence is able to distinguish them from classifiers that have a similar overall performance and ones that perform better on the lowly weighted observations.
  Furthermore, we prove that the weighted measures are robust with respect to the choice of weights in a precise manner:
  if the weights are changed by at most $ε$, the value of the weighted measure changes at most by a factor of $ε$ in the binary case

Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement.

Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant ""deliberative misalignment"", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation.

Despite its clinical importance, CMD remains underdiagnosed due to the reliance on invasive procedures such as pressure wire-based measurements of the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), which are costly, time-consuming, and carry procedural risks. To date, no study has sought to quantify CMD indices using data-driven approaches while leveraging the rich information contained in coronary angiograms. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel data-driven framework for inference of CMD indices based on coronary angiography. A physiologically validated multi-physics model was used to generate synthetic datasets for data-driven model training, consisting of CMD indices and computational angiograms with corresponding contrast intensity profiles (CIPs). Two neural network architectures were developed: a single-input-channel encoder-MLP model for IMR prediction and a dual-input-channel encoder-MLP model for CFR prediction, both incorporating epistemic uncertainty estimation to quantify prediction confidence. Results demonstrate that the data-driven models achieve high predictive accuracy when evaluated against physics-based synthetic datasets, and that the uncertainty estimates are positively correlated with prediction errors. Furthermore, the utility of CIPs as informative surrogates for coronary physiology is demonstrated, underscoring the potential of the proposed framework to enable accurate, real-time, image-based CMD assessment using routine angiography without the need for more invasive approaches.",2025-12-25,discard,0.9,"This is a domain-specific medical imaging / cardiology paper (angiography-based estimation of CMD indices) and does not map to our core PE workflows (document/RAG/agentic systems for diligence, report generation, tool integrations).

Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.82,"This is directly relevant to enterprise deployment risk management: it proposes a concrete, mechanistic, inference-time debiasing approach (sparse autoencoder feature ablations) that aims to reduce harmful stereotypes without degrading core capabilities.

These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies.

The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance.

We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench).

Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training.

In this report, a residual learning network-assisted simulated annealing (ResNet-SA) framework is proposed to address this mismatch without requiring explicit knowledge of the distorted electric field. By learning the residual difference between the theoretical and true antenna gains, a neural network (NN) is embedded in a heuristic optimization algorithm to find the optimal weight vector.

Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities.

Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning.

Our goal is to measure the systematic uncertainties caused by the assumed geometry, with a focus on key parameters such as the black hole spin and the inclination of the inner accretion disk. We find that the disk-like corona gives a fit that is statistically similar to the broken power-law and lamppost models, but it leads to more physically reasonable results, such as a lower inclination angle of about $30^{\circ}$. By using a variable disk density model, we measure the disk density to be $n_{\rm e}\approx10^{20}$\,cm$^{-3}$, which is similar to earlier results.

Existing approaches to evaluating pedestrian environments often rely on static, infrastructure-based indices or retrospective surveys, which overlook the dynamic, subjective, and psychophysiological dimensions of everyday walking experience. This paper introduces a multimodal, human-centered framework for assessing pedestrian well-being in the wild by integrating three complementary data streams: continuous physiological sensing, geospatial tracking, and momentary self-reports collected using the Experience Sampling Method. The framework conceptualizes pedestrian experience as a triangulation enabling a holistic understanding of how urban environments influence well-being. The utility of our framework is then demonstrated through a naturalistic case study conducted in the Greater Philadelphia region, in which participants wore research-grade wearable sensors and carried GPS-enabled smartphones during their regular daily activities. Physiological indicators of autonomic nervous system activity, including heart rate variability and electrodermal activity, were synchronized with spatial trajectories and in situ self-reports of stress, affect, and perceived infrastructure conditions. Results illustrate substantial inter- and intra-individual variability in both subjective experience and physiological response, as well as context-dependent patterns associated with traffic exposure, pedestrian infrastructure quality, and environmental enclosure. The findings also suggest that commonly used walkability indices may not fully capture experiential dimensions of pedestrian well-being.

Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition.

We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime.

In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\%, 92.61\%, and 99.83\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

The critical gap must also exist in a person's mind and hence, together with the perceived gap, is a latent variable. Finally, it is also proposed that the critical gap is influenced by various exogenous variables such as subject and opposing vehicle types, and perceived waiting time. Mathematical models that (i) incorporate systematic and random distortions during the perception process and (ii) account for the effect of the various influencing variables are developed. The parameters of these models are estimated for two different gap acceptance data sets using the maximum likelihood technique. The data is collected as part of this study. The estimated parameters throw valuable insights into how these influencing variables affect the critical gap. The results corroborate the initial predictions on the nature of influence these variables must exert and give strength to the gap acceptance decision-making construct proposed here. This work also proposes a methodology to estimate a measurable/observable world emulator of the latent variable critical gap.

However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency.

Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions.

Using intersection theory, Chern-Mather classes, and the Nash blow-up provided by Kempf's resolution, we reduce the computation of the virtual Euclidean Distance degree to explicit intersection numbers on a Grassmannian.

Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $ρ$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $ρ$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $Δ\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $Δ\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values.

As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness.
  In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack.

When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass.

To address this gap, large language model (LLM)-empowered agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating reasoning, planning, and adaptation to enable QoE-aware network management. In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation.

However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan.

To address this, this paper proposes TSA-LLM, a large language model (LLM)-based universal framework that models multi-variate transient dynamics prediction as a univariate generative task with three key innovations: First, a novel data processing pipeline featuring channel independence decomposition to resolve dimensional heterogeneity, sample-wise normalization to eliminate separate stable or unstable pipelines, and temporal patching for efficient long-sequence modeling; Second, a parameter-efficient freeze-and-finetune strategy that augments the LLM's architecture with dedicated input embedding and output projection layers while freezing core transformer blocks to preserve generic feature extraction capabilities; Third, a two-stage fine-tuning scheme that combines teacher forcing, which feeds the model ground-truth data during initial training, with scheduled sampling, which gradually shifts to leveraging model-generated predictions, to mitigate cumulative errors in long-horizon iterative prediction. Comprehensive testing demonstrates the framework's universality, as TSA-LLM trained solely on the New England 39-bus system achieves zero-shot generalization to mixed stability conditions and unseen faults, and matches expert performance on the larger Iceland 189-bus system with only 5% fine-tuning data.

While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms.

To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm.

Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric.

Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray.

This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM embeddings in the context of inherent geometric properties. We investigate the structural properties of these embeddings through three complementary metrics $δ$-hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining. $δ$-hyperbolicity, a measure derived from geometric group theory, quantifies how much a metric space deviates from being a tree-like structure. In contrast, ultrametricity characterizes strictly hierarchical structures where distances obey a strong triangle inequality. While Neighbor Joining quantifies how tree-like the distance relationships are, it does so specifically with respect to the tree reconstructed by the Neighbor Joining algorithm. By analyzing the embeddings generated by LLMs using these metrics, we uncover to what extent the embedding space reflects an underlying hierarchical or tree-like organization.

We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting.

In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated.

This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) unifies nearly two decades of CPS resilience research into a structured Origin-Layer-Effect (OLE) taxonomy. This taxonomy provides a cross-layer lens for understanding how faults arise, how they propagate, and why unrelated CPS failures often share deep structural similarities. By mapping representative systems including RockDrone, MAYDAY, M2MON, HACMS, Byzantine fault-tolerant control, and learning-based recovery mechanisms onto the taxonomy, we reveal patterns of coverage, persistent blind spots, and recurring pathways of fault amplification.

While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics.

However, the extreme sensitivity of optical beams to relative satellite motion, pointing jitter, and rapidly evolving geometry makes routing fundamentally more challenging than in RF-based systems.

While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.",2025-12-25,discard,0.78,"This is a niche medical-imaging (breast ultrasound) segmentation paper, which is far from Carlyle’s core needs around document understanding, RAG, agent workflows, and financial diligence automation.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20781v1,Soft Filtering: Guiding Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval with Prescriptive and Proscriptive Constraints,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to find a target image that aligns with user intent, expressed through a reference image and a modification text. While Zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods sidestep the need for labeled training data by leveraging pretrained vision-language models, they often rely on a single fused query that merges all descriptive cues of what the user wants, tending to dilute key information and failing to account for what they wish to avoid. Moreover, current CIR benchmarks assume a single correct target per query, overlooking the ambiguity in modification texts. To address these challenges, we propose Soft Filtering with Textual constraints (SoFT), a training-free, plug-and-play filtering module for ZS-CIR. SoFT leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to extract two complementary constraints from the reference-modification pair: prescriptive (must-have) and proscriptive (must-avoid) constraints. These serve as semantic filters that reward or penalize candidate images to re-rank results, without modifying the base retrieval model or adding supervision. In addition, we construct a two-stage dataset pipeline that refines CIR benchmarks. We first identify multiple plausible targets per query to construct multi-target triplets, capturing the open-ended nature of user intent. Then guide multimodal LLMs to rewrite the modification text to focus on one target, while referencing contrastive distractors to ensure precision. This enables more comprehensive and reliable evaluation under varying ambiguity levels. Applied on top of CIReVL, a ZS-CIR retriever, SoFT raises R@5 to 65.25 on CIRR (+12.94), mAP@50 to 27.93 on CIRCO (+6.13), and R@50 to 58.44 on FashionIQ (+4.59), demonstrating broad effectiveness.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.82,"This is a recent, training-free, plug-and-play reranking approach that operationalizes “must-have” vs “must-avoid” constraints using multimodal LLMs—highly relevant to improving retrieval quality and controllability (a recurring pain point in RAG and multimodal search).

In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.62,"Although framed in Dec-POMDP theory (more common in robotics/control), it directly tackles a problem we repeatedly face in multi-agent LLM systems: agents acting with inconsistent internal beliefs/context under limited (costly) communication.

The approach relies solely on a monocular camera with fiducials for target tracking and operates entirely in the local observer frame without the need for global information. The core contribution of this work is a streamlined and general approach to autonomous interception that can be adapted across robots with varying dynamics, as well as our comprehensive study of the robot interception problem across heterogenous mobility systems under limited observability and no global localization. Our method integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation amid intermittent measurements, (2) a history-conditioned motion predictor for dynamic target trajectory propagation, and (3) a receding-horizon planner solving a constrained convex program in real time to ensure time-efficient and kinematically feasible interception paths. Our operating regime assumes that observability is restricted by partial fields of view, sensor dropouts, and target occlusions. Experiments are performed in these conditions and include autonomous UAV landing on dynamic targets, rover rendezvous and leader-follower tasks, and spacecraft proximity operations. Results from simulated and physical experiments demonstrate robust performance with low interception errors (both during station-keeping and upon scenario completion), high success rates under deterministic and stochastic target motion profiles, and real-time execution on embedded processors such as the Jetson Orin, VOXL2, and Raspberry Pi 5.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.84,"This is directly relevant to our “reasoning + post-training” track: it empirically characterizes when RLVR (verifiable rewards) actually improves generalization vs. SFT, across model sizes and task difficulty axes—exactly the kind of insight we need when deciding whether RLVR is worth the engineering cost in production pipelines. The causal-graph inference testbed is also a clean proxy for multi-step reasoning with intermediate arithmetic/probability errors, which maps well to diligence-style analytical workflows; the paper’s reported conditions (initial competence thresholds, training level mix) are actionable and can inform how we stage RLVR after SFT and how we design verifiers.",2025-12-26T23:51:12.571798

Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies.

However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution.

While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision.

Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling.

However, neither architecture is adequate to flexibly support distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services, due to the increasing difficulty of aligning spatiotemporally distributed heterogeneous service demands with available radio resources. In this paper, we propose an elastic network topology (ENT) for distributed ISAC service provisioning, where multiple co-existing localized CCNs can be dynamically aggregated into CFNs with expanded boundaries for federated network operation. This topology elastically orchestrates localized CCN and federated CFN boundaries to balance signaling overhead and distributed resource utilization, thereby enabling efficient ISAC service provisioning. A two-phase operation protocol is then developed. In Phase I, each CCN autonomously classifies ISAC services as either local or federated and partitions its resources into dedicated and shared segments. In Phase II, each CCN employs its dedicated resources for local ISAC services, while the aggregated CFN consolidates shared resources from its constituent CCNs to cooperatively deliver federated services. Furthermore, we design a utility-to-signaling ratio (USR) to quantify the tradeoff between sensing/communication utility and signaling overhead. Consequently, a USR maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the network topology (i.e., service classification and CCN aggregation) and the allocation of dedicated and shared resources. However, this problem is challenging due to its distributed optimization nature and the absence of complete channel state information.

In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.",2025-12-25,discard,0.9,"This is a domain-specific astrophysics study (gravitational-wave detector network design) and the core contribution is evaluating ET/CE configurations rather than advancing generally useful agent/RAG/LLM infrastructure.

The provided webpage focuses heavily on **Self-Reflection in Language Models** and directly addresses several components of the query:

*   **Self-reflection:** This is the main topic, defined as the ability of LLMs to generate, review, and revise outputs through an internal audit process to improve quality, reduce hallucinations, and mitigate bias.
*   **Chain-of-thought:** The text mentions **Chain-of-thought self-evaluation** as a core mechanism of self-reflection, where the model audits each step of its reasoning process for logic and consistency.
*   **Hallucination reduction and detection:** Self-reflection is explicitly stated to improve quality and **reduce hallucinations**. It helps prevent **overconfident wrong answers** through uncertainty estimation.
*   **Factuality/Grounding:** Self-reflection helps catch contradictions and ensures factual alignment, especially when combined with external retrieval (mentioned in the context of Self-RAG).
*   **Reasoning LLMs:** The mechanisms described (CoT evaluation, iterative refinement) are techniques used to enhance reasoning capabilities.
*   **Planning with LLMs:** Iterative response refinement mentions approaches like **Tree-of-Thoughts** (a planning technique) which formalizes evaluating alternative reasoning trajectories.

The page does **not** explicitly discuss:
*   Inference-time compute (beyond mentioning latency trade-offs in integration methods).
*   MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for language models (though Tree-of-Thoughts is mentioned as a related formalization).
*   Test-time scaling.
*   Grounding (though factuality/RAG integration is mentioned).

**Summary:**

The webpage details the concept and implementation of **Self-Reflection in Language Models** as a method to improve output quality, consistency, and reliability.

The webpage, ""o1: A Technical Primer,"" discusses OpenAI's ""reasoning model"" o1, which exhibits **test-time scaling laws**.

Here is a summary of how the page addresses the query topics:

*   **Reasoning LLMs & Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** The page centers on o1, described as OpenAI's first ""reasoning model."" It explicitly states that o1 performs **implicit search via chain of thought (CoT)**, which was trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to improve productive thinking. Standard CoT techniques are mentioned as predecessors.
*   **Inference-time compute & Test-time scaling:** This is a core theme. The text introduces **test-time scaling laws**, which show how to exchange **inference-time compute** for better decisions, contrasting with traditional training-time scaling laws.
*   **Planning with LLMs & MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for language models:** The hypotheses for how o1 works include **Guidance** (Hypothesis 3), which discusses using intermediate feedback to guide sampling, mentioning **beam search** and the more complex **Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** as potential inspiration or mechanisms for distillation into the model.

The provided webpage focuses heavily on **scaling inference-time compute optimally** for LLMs, which directly addresses the ""inference-time compute"" and ""test-time scaling"" aspects of the query.

Here is a summary of the page content relevant to the query:

The paper investigates how to optimally scale **test-time computation** in Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve performance on challenging prompts, suggesting this can be more effective than scaling model parameters alone.

**Key Findings and Concepts Related to Reasoning and Test-Time Compute:**

*   **Test-Time Compute Scaling:** The core finding is that the effectiveness of different test-time compute methods (like iterative self-refinement/revisions or search against a verifier) critically depends on the **difficulty of the prompt**. This motivates a **""compute-optimal"" scaling strategy** that adaptively allocates test-time compute based on prompt difficulty.
*   **Comparison to Model Scaling:** Using this compute-optimal strategy, the authors found that for certain problems, test-time compute can outperform a model that is $14\times$ larger in parameters, suggesting a trade-off where smaller models with more inference compute might be preferable to very large pretrained models in some settings.
*   **Mechanisms for Scaling Compute:** The study analyzes two primary mechanisms:
    1.  **Updating the model's distribution adaptively (Proposal Distribution Refinement):** This includes **sequential revisions** (self-reflection/self-critique), where the model iteratively refines its answer. Sequential revisions were found to be generally better than parallel sampling for refinement tasks, especially on easier problems.
    2.  **Searching against a Verifier (Planning):** This involves using a **Process Reward Model (PRM)** to score intermediate steps. Search methods like **Beam Search** were found to be more effective than simple **Best-of-N** sampling on harder questions, as they help guide the model toward correct high-level approaches. The paper notes that Lookahead Search is a specialized, deterministic version of **MCTS** applied at

The user query asks for a summary related to several advanced LLM reasoning and planning concepts, including **Reasoning LLMs, chain-of-thought, inference-time compute, self-reflection, planning with LLMs, MCTS for language models, test-time scaling, hallucination reduction and detection, grounding, and factuality.**

The provided webpage text focuses heavily on **test-time compute scaling**, specifically comparing sequential revisions (self-reflection/refinement) and parallel sampling (search with verifiers) based on question difficulty. It also discusses the **exchange between pretraining compute and test-time compute**.

Here is a summary of the relevant points from the text concerning the user's query:

*   **Test-Time Compute Scaling & Optimality:** The text demonstrates that there is an ideal ratio between sequential revisions (refining the proposal distribution) and parallel sampling (search with verifiers) for maximizing accuracy at a given generation budget. This optimal ratio depends critically on the **question's difficulty**: easier questions benefit more from sequential revisions, while harder questions require a balance.
*   **Efficiency of Compute Scaling:** By optimally scaling test-time compute according to question difficulty, the model can outperform the standard best-of-N baseline using up to **4x less test-time compute**.
*   **Exchanging Pretraining and Test-Time Compute:** The study investigates whether increasing test-time compute can compensate for less pretraining compute (FLOPs-matched setting).
    *   On **easy and medium questions** or in settings with **small inference requirements** ($R \ll 1$), test-time compute is often more effective than scaling model parameters during pretraining.
    *   On **challenging questions** or under **higher inference requirements** ($R \gg 1$), increasing pretraining compute (scaling model parameters) is more effective.
*   **Related Work (Context for Reasoning/Planning):** The related work section mentions techniques that fall under the user's query, such as:
    *   **Chain-of-Thought** (implied by step-by-step reasoning).
    *   **Self-reflection/Refinement** (critique and revise).
    *   **Test-time compute scaling** using **verifiers** and **search** (which relates to planning/MCTS).

**Key points related to the query:**

*   **Reasoning and Planning with LLMs:** LLMs often struggle with long-term planning and goal-conditioned reasoning because they are primarily trained for next-token prediction, leading to locally plausible but globally suboptimal outputs.
*   **MCTS for Language Models:** MCTS is proposed as a method to navigate the vast search space of language generation by exploring multiple potential continuations, simulating outcomes, and using rewards to guide the process.
*   **Benefits of MCTS Integration:**
    *   **Improve Planning:** Helps LLMs evaluate steps ahead to align with long-term objectives.
    *   **Improve Coherence:** Reduces contradictions by assessing simulated outcomes.
    *   **Optimise Reasoning:** Allows exploration of diverse problem-solving strategies.
    *   **Handle Large Token Spaces:** Systematically explores vocabulary options.
*   **Reformulation (State, Action, Reward):** Reasoning is reframed as an MCTS search where:
    *   **State:** The current status of the reasoning process (e.g., partially constructed solution).
    *   **Actions:** Meaningful reasoning moves (e.g., applying a rule or making an inference).
    *   **Reward:** Assigned based on the correctness and relevance of the path's outcome, guiding the search toward desirable solutions.
*   **Inference-Time Compute/Test-Time Scaling:** The MCTS process inherently involves iterative exploration and simulation at inference time, which addresses the need for strategic computation beyond simple next-token prediction.

The page focuses heavily on MCTS as a mechanism for improving planning and reasoning in LLMs, but it **does not explicitly detail** concepts like ""self-reflection,"" ""grounding,"" ""factuality,"" or specific techniques for ""hallucination reduction and detection"" beyond the general improvement in coherence and logical consistency provided by MCTS.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.72,"This is directly relevant to our core theme of inference-time compute/test-time scaling for better reasoning and planning, and MCTS-style search is a practical pattern we could adapt for tool-using agents and long-horizon workflows (e.g., diligence Q&A and report generation).

reasoning_and_planning,exa,https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.329.pdf,Untitled,Exa,2025-10-22,"The provided web page text details a framework called **LCoT2Tree** designed for the **structural analysis of Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Here is a summary addressing the key concepts in your query:

*   **Reasoning LLMs & Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** The paper focuses on LCoT, a strategy where LLMs engage in deliberate, step-by-step reasoning (System 2 thinking) before answering, which has enabled expert-level performance in complex tasks.
*   **Inference-time Compute & Test-time Scaling:** The paper addresses the ""overthinking"" phenomenon, where overly long reasoning chains can degrade performance, suggesting that simply increasing inference-time compute (length) is an unreliable predictor of correctness.
*   **Self-reflection & Planning with LLMs:** The LCoT2Tree framework analyzes structural patterns like **exploration, backtracking, and verification** within the reasoning chain, which are key components of structured reasoning and self-correction.
*   **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for language models:** While MCTS is not explicitly mentioned, the tree structure derived by LCoT2Tree models hierarchical reasoning paths, which shares conceptual similarities with tree-based search strategies.
*   **Hallucination Reduction and Detection & Grounding/Factuality:** The paper focuses on *structural* success rather than semantic correctness. It notes that structural analysis alone cannot capture semantic errors (like calculation mistakes or misinterpretation), indicating that combining structural insights with semantic verification is necessary for comprehensive **factuality** assessment.
*   **Structural Analysis:** The core contribution is LCoT2Tree, which converts sequential LCoTs into hierarchical trees. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are used on these trees to predict answer correctness with significantly higher accuracy than length-based methods.
*   **Practical Application:** The structural analysis is applied to improve **Best-of-N decoding** by selecting candidates based on the quality of their reasoning structure rather than just the final outcome.

In summary, the paper introduces a method to diagnose and improve LLM reasoning by analyzing the *structure* of the thought process, finding that structural patterns are stronger predictors of success than response length.

The webpage text primarily details the **LCoT2Tree framework**, a method for converting Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) reasoning traces from Large Language Models (LLMs) into structured tree representations for analysis and classification.

Key aspects related to your query include:

*   **Reasoning LLMs and Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** The work analyzes reasoning traces from various LLMs (DeepSeek-32B, QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-R1, Seed-1.5-Thinking-pro, Grok-3-mini-beta) across benchmarks like MATH, GPQA, LCB, and MMLU-Pro. It references foundational work on CoT prompting (e.g., Kojima et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b).
*   **Inference-time Compute/Scaling:** The references section includes papers discussing scaling inference compute (Snell et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025) and test-time scaling (Muennighoff et al., 2025).
*   **Self-Reflection/Self-Correction:** The references mention work on self-correction (Gou et al., 2024, CRITIC) and self-refinement (Madaan et al., 2023, Self-refine).
*   **Planning with LLMs/MCTS:** The references include ""Graph of thoughts"" (Besta et al., 2024) and ""Tree of thoughts"" (Yao et al., 2023), which are related to structured planning methods.
*   **Hallucination Reduction and Detection/Factuality:** The analysis of error behaviors (Section D.1) and the use of reasoning structure for correctness classification implicitly address issues related to factual errors or flawed reasoning paths. The framework aims to classify correct vs. incorrect reasoning structures.
*   **Grounding:** The references include work on grounded mathematical proof generation (Welleck et al., 2022).

The core contribution described is the **LCoT2Tree process**, which uses an LLM in five stages (Extract Sketch, Split Thought, Assign Step, Identify Function, Build Tree) to structure the CoT, allowing for the analysis of reasoning structure (e.g",2025-12-25,pursue,0.82,"This looks highly relevant to our “reasoning quality at inference time” problems: converting long CoT traces into a tree and using structural signals (exploration/backtracking/verification) to predict correctness could directly improve best-of-N / candidate selection and reduce “overthinking” failures in QA and report-generation workflows.

It focuses on how LLMs, particularly through **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting, can perform complex reasoning tasks beyond simple next-token prediction.

Here is a summary of the page content relevant to your query:

*   **Reasoning LLMs and Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** The paper reviews the field of LLM reasoning, which gained traction with the CoT approach. CoT involves prompting the LLM to generate intermediate reasoning steps (""Let’s think step by step"") to solve difficult problems, especially math word problems (like those in the GSM8K benchmark).
*   **Inference-Time Compute:** In-context learning, which includes CoT, occurs at **inference-time** where model parameters are not adapted. The performance gains rely on the model's existing knowledge and the prompt structure.
*   **Planning with LLMs:** The survey discusses a general three-stage pipeline for multi-step reasoning: **Generate, Evaluate, and Control** steps. Planning falls under the **Control** stage, which can involve complex strategies like ensemble methods or using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** algorithms (including in-context RL) to explore different reasoning paths dynamically.
*   **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for Language Models:** While MCTS is not explicitly named, the concept of tree search is mentioned under the **Control** stage (3.3.3), where algorithms like **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)** use search methods (like BFS/DFS) to scaffold the reasoning process, allowing the LLM to roll back and try different steps.
*   **Self-Reflection:** **Self-reflection** is explicitly mentioned as being used in many multi-step methods, often implemented via **Self-verification** (where the LLM evaluates its own steps) or as part of reinforcement learning fine-tuning loops.
*   **Hallucination Reduction and Detection / Grounding:** The text touches upon grounding in the context of robotics, where approaches like **Say-can** use external physics models to ground reasoning steps in reality, which helps reduce errors (a form of hallucination reduction). Tool-based validation (using external interpreters for generated code) also serves to ground the reasoning in verifiable logic.
*   **Factuality:** While the term ""

The provided webpage text discusses many of these concepts in detail:

*   **Reasoning LLMs & Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** The text extensively covers various reasoning approaches, including **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**, **Least-to-most prompting**, **Program-of-thought**, and **Program-aided-language**, which use LLMs to generate step-by-step reasoning.
*   **Planning with LLMs:** Planning is discussed in the context of **Robotic Behavior** (e.g., Say-can, Inner-monologue, Chain-of-tools) and in the control stage using search algorithms like **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)**, which explores a search tree with backtracking.
*   **Inference-time Compute & Control:** The text details three main approaches for controlling reasoning steps at inference time: **greedy selection** (like standard CoT), **ensemble strategy** (like Self-consistency), and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** search, which involves external algorithms traversing a search tree.
*   **Self-Reflection & Self-Improvement:** Several methods involve the model evaluating and correcting its own output, such as **Self-debugging**, **Refiner**, **Self-correction**, **Self-improvement**, **Self-refine**, and **Reflexion** (which uses an actor, evaluator, and reflector model).
*   **Hallucination Reduction & Grounding:** The text notes that reasoning suffers from **hallucination** when not properly grounded. **Grounding** is achieved by combining LLMs with external tools or knowledge sources, such as using external models for **robotic affordances** (Say-can) or retrieving information from **Wikipedia** (ReAct).
*   **Factuality & Faithfulness:** The text addresses the issue of **faithfulness**—whether the model followed the stated reasoning steps or arrived at the answer through an unfaithful path.

It works by guiding the LLM to break down a problem into smaller, sequential reasoning steps before providing the final answer.

**Key aspects of CoT prompting mentioned in the text:**

*   **Mechanism:** Instead of asking for a direct answer, the prompt encourages the model to show its work step-by-step, similar to how a student solves a math problem.
*   **Usefulness:** It is particularly effective for tasks requiring **logical thinking**, such as mathematical problem-solving, common sense reasoning, and understanding cause-and-effect relationships.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Improved Accuracy:** Breaking down the problem reduces the likelihood of errors.
    *   **Increased Transparency:** Users can see exactly how the model arrived at its conclusion, making the reasoning process understandable and trustworthy.
*   **Application:** CoT is useful for both human users interacting with chatbots and for backend systems making API calls to LLMs that require precision in logical tasks.

Key findings related to your query:

*   **Reasoning and Planning (Test-Time Compute):** Increasing test-time computation does **not consistently improve accuracy** on knowledge-intensive tasks for most models evaluated (14 reasoning models). In many cases, it leads to **more hallucinations**.
*   **Hallucination Reduction and Detection:** Reduced hallucinations with longer reasoning are often due to the model choosing to **abstain** from answering rather than improved factual recall. Conversely, increased hallucinations occur because longer reasoning encourages models to **attempt previously unanswered questions**, many of which result in fabrication.
*   **Self-Reflection/Confirmation Bias:** Extended reasoning can induce **confirmation bias**, leading models to fabricate details to support an initial belief, resulting in overconfident hallucinations (demonstrated with `gpt-oss-20b`).
*   **Grounding/Factuality:** The study emphasizes that for knowledge-intensive tasks requiring high factual accuracy, current test-time scaling is limited because models struggle to verify facts without external sources, leading to reasoning chains filled with fabricated details.
*   **Thinking vs. Non-Thinking:** Despite the limitations of scaling *within* the thinking mode, enabling thinking (compared to a non-thinking mode) is still generally **beneficial**, improving accuracy (especially for multi-hop reasoning) and reducing hallucinations for most models.

In summary, while reasoning techniques are employed, simply increasing the inference-time compute via test-time scaling is currently ineffective and potentially detrimental to factuality in knowledge-intensive domains.

The provided text discusses experimental settings, prompt details, and results related to **test-time reasoning/scaling** for Language Models (LLMs), including comparisons between models with and without ""thinking"" (reasoning effort/budget). It also explores **parallel sampling** (self-consistency) for knowledge-intensive tasks, noting that it primarily reduces hallucinations through abstention rather than improving accuracy. Finally, it provides case studies illustrating how increased reasoning computation can lead to either abstention or **hallucination** (confirmation bias).

While the text heavily focuses on **test-time compute**, **hallucination reduction and detection**, and **grounding** (implied by the focus on factual accuracy and abstention), it does not explicitly detail:
*   **Reasoning LLMs** (beyond the context of test-time reasoning methods).
*   **Chain-of-thought** (though the ""thinking"" mechanism is related).

While the platform supports various analysis tasks, including financial data extraction and risk identification, the user query specifically asks about **multi-agent systems for finance, private equity, venture capital, due diligence automation, investment opportunity analysis, deal sourcing, portfolio monitoring, agents for data analysis, financial report generation, and integrations with PitchBook, AlphaSense, Preqin, CapIQ, and Bloomberg.**

ToltIQ focuses heavily on **due diligence automation, data analysis, and portfolio monitoring** within the private equity context. It mentions integration with VDRs and CRM systems via secure APIs, but **it does not explicitly mention agents for deal sourcing, investment opportunity analysis, or integrations with specific external data providers like PitchBook, AlphaSense, Preqin, CapIQ, or Bloomberg.**

**Key areas where AI is applied in PE operations:**

1.  **Deal Origination:** Automating the screening, enrichment, and scoring of inbound opportunities, and identifying market signals for potential targets.
2.  **Due Diligence and Underwriting (Highest ROI):** AI significantly cuts down the ""grunt work"" of financial modeling and preliminary screening, allowing analysts to shift from spending 90% of their time crunching numbers to spending 90% on strategic analysis. This can reduce financial modeling time by up to 90% and increase deal evaluation capacity by 50%.
3.  **Portfolio and Fund Management:** Standardizing reporting across portfolio companies and automatically flagging performance anomalies.

**Regarding the specific tools mentioned in the query:**

The text mentions the challenges of integrating AI with existing PE tech stacks (like Excel, iLevel, Chronograph) and suggests building a central data warehouse (like Snowflake) for clean data pipelines. However, the article **does not explicitly mention or discuss** the use of specific third-party platforms like **PitchBook, AlphaSense, Preqin, CapIQ, or Bloomberg integrations** in the context of AI agents or automation.

**Summary relevant to the query:**

The page details how AI acts as a force multiplier in private equity, primarily by automating due diligence to speed up deal evaluation from weeks to days.

**Key points about Rerankers:**

*   **Purpose:** They address the limitations of single-stage retrieval (where embedding models might miss relevant documents or rank them poorly) by scoring and reordering the top $k$ candidate documents retrieved by the vector database.
*   **Mechanism (Cross-Encoders):** Unlike the initial retrieval's bi-encoders (which encode query and document separately), rerankers are typically **cross-encoders** that process the query and document together to capture deeper, context-specific semantic relationships, resulting in a direct relevance score.
*   **Two-Stage Paradigm:**
    1.  **First Stage (Recall):** Fast vector search retrieves a larger set of candidates ($k$).
    2.  **Second Stage (Precision):** Rerankers reorder these candidates, selecting the top $n$ (usually 3–5) most relevant documents to pass to the LLM.
*   **Benefits:** Adding rerankers can improve retrieval quality by **14–30%**. They also allow the use of smaller, faster embedding models in the first stage, significantly boosting indexing throughput and reducing computational costs while maintaining high overall accuracy.

Here's a summary of key points about rerankers based on the text:

*   **Function:** They take the initial set of documents retrieved (often via vector search) and refine them into a smaller set of highly relevant chunks before they are sent to the generative model. This improves the accuracy of the final response.
*   **Mechanism:** Reranker models are **cross-encoders**. They encode each query-document pair individually and produce a relevance score.
*   **Difference from Embedding Models:** Embedding models are **bi-encoders** that produce vectors (embeddings) for separate encoding and use efficient similarity computation. Rerankers do not produce embeddings; they require the input data to pass through the model for every pair, making the process computationally expensive but resulting in more precise relevance scoring and a better understanding of contextual nuances.

**Summary:**

The webpage details the **DynamicRAG** framework, which significantly improves **RAG architectures** by introducing a **reranker** optimized via Reinforcement Learning using feedback from the generator's output quality. This allows the reranker to dynamically adjust the number and order of retrieved documents. The paper compares DynamicRAG against various **RAG alternatives** and baselines, showing superior performance. However, the text does not discuss **vector databases**, specific **embeddings (new efficient models)**, **hybrid search**, or **chunking strategies**.

The user query asks for a summary covering several topics related to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), including: **Vector databases, embeddings (new efficient models), rerankers, RAG architectures, RAG alternatives, hybrid search, and chunking strategies.**

The provided web page text focuses on a specific RAG architecture called **DynamicRAG**, which leverages Large Language Model (LLM) outputs as feedback for **dynamic reranking**.

Here is a summary of the relevant points from the text concerning the user's query:

*   **Rerankers:** The paper heavily focuses on reranking. It compares different Reranker and Generator model sizes (e.g., 7B vs 13B) and finds that a larger Reranker can enhance performance. It also introduces a method where the Reranker and Generator share parameters, leading to improved performance. The core of DynamicRAG is using the LLM response quality as a reward signal to optimize the reranker via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
*   **RAG Architectures:** The paper introduces **DynamicRAG**, a novel RL framework that optimizes reranking dynamically based on feedback. It is compared against **Vanilla-RAG** and shows significant performance improvements. Ablation studies confirm the critical importance of retrieval and the beneficial effect of reranking and RL in the architecture.
*   **Embeddings/Retrieval:** The text mentions using different **retrievers** (DPR, Contriever, MonoT5) and shows that DynamicRAG's performance improves as the underlying retriever models get better, demonstrating robustness. The initial retrieval step uses the top 45 documents retrieved by **Contriever-MS MARCO**.
*   **Efficiency:** The DynamicRAG model is shown to be highly efficient, requiring only two LLM calls in one evaluation scenario and demonstrating approximately **17x superior throughput** compared to a sequential scoring approach like RankRAG, as it processes documents contextually rather than sequentially.

**Topics not explicitly covered in detail:**

*   **Vector databases:** Not mentioned.
*   **Embeddings (new efficient models):** While retrievers are used (which rely on embeddings), the text does not detail new efficient embedding models themselves, only the performance impact of using different existing retrievers.

Key points covered include:

*   **Core Idea:** Reranking reorders passages retrieved by vector search to ensure the final answer is grounded on the most relevant context. The authors use an LLM reranker instead of traditional open-source cross-encoders for better quality.
*   **Reranking Methods:** The guide focuses on **pointwise reranking**, where the LLM scores each passage individually (on a scale of 1-10), as it allows for easier optimization compared to listwise or pairwise methods.
*   **Optimizations for Speed and Latency:** To address the latency issues caused by large inputs/outputs when reranking many passages ($K=40$):
    *   **Reducing Output Tokens:** Switching to a `Dict` format and implementing thresholding (omitting scores below 5) significantly cut latency.
    *   **Parallel Reranking:** Splitting the candidate passages into batches ($N$ workers) and scoring them in parallel. A **round-robin batching strategy** is used to ensure each batch receives a mix of high/medium/low similarity passages, mitigating positional bias from the initial vector search.
*   **Impact:** The optimizations reduced added latency from $\sim 5$ seconds to **$<1$s** and cut costs by $\sim 8$x, while showing a statistically significant quality uplift over the open-source BGE reranker in A/B tests for both the Fin and Copilot agents.
*   **RAG Architectures:** The article briefly mentions how Copilot maintains **source diversity** by retrieving and scoring content across different types (internal, public, conversation history) in parallel streams before merging.

Key aspects covered include:

*   **Problem:** Standard multimodal RAG often fails because image captions/summaries lack the necessary context to distinguish between similar elements (like tables for ""producers"" vs. ""processors"") in complex documents.
*   **Improved Pipeline Changes:**
    1.  **Context-Aware Image Summaries:** Instead of just summarizing the image, the system extracts up to 200 characters of text immediately *before and after* the figure/table to create a contextually rich caption.
    2.  **Text Response Guided Image Selection:** Image retrieval is performed *after* the textual response is generated, matching the best images to the generated text rather than directly matching the user query to image embeddings.
*   **Implementation Details:** The process uses the **Adobe PDF Extract API** for reliable parsing of PDFs (including figures and tables), GPT-4o for quality checking images and generating summaries, and FAISS for indexing embeddings.
*   **Results:** The tests show that this enhanced approach successfully retrieves highly relevant figures and tables for specific queries related to financial reports, research papers (like VectorPainter and CLIP distillation), demonstrating improved accuracy in multimodal retrieval.

This process includes **chart/table extraction** and general document layout segmentation.
*   **Multimodal Processing:** The system handles complex documents containing text, images, figures, and tables, using vision models for structure extraction and potentially multi-modal LLMs for image summarization.
*   **Report Generation with LLMs:** One of the key use cases mentioned is **Report Generation and Business Intelligence (BI)**, where LLM-powered document pipelines generate summaries or extract structured datasets from document collections.
*   **LLM Integration:** LLMs are used extensively throughout the system, particularly in the **Luna** query planner to translate natural language queries into executable plans (Sycamore scripts) and for semantic operators like `llmExtract` and `llmFilter`.
*   **Comparison to RAG:** The paper explicitly shows that Aryn (Luna) achieves significantly better accuracy (67% correct vs. 6.7% for RAG) on complex analytical queries over NTSB reports, especially when the required information is spread across multiple documents, which often causes RAG systems to fail or be poisoned by boilerplate text.

We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies.

We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes.

Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.
  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a ""quality function"" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.
  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings.

This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data.

We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization.

Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG).

On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$μ$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.",2025-12-25,discard,0.87,"This is a credible, very recent arXiv paper, but it’s narrowly focused on TinyML hardware-aware NAS for trash/object detection on microcontrollers (TACO/MAX78002), which doesn’t map to Carlyle’s core needs (LLM reasoning/agents, RAG, document/PDF understanding, or finance-specific workflows). The methods (Once-for-All supernet + evolutionary search + accuracy predictor) are broadly interesting, but the practical takeaways are likely tied to embedded CV deployment rather than improving diligence/document analysis systems we run in cloud environments.",2025-12-26T23:51:12.607656

Cognitive Radio Networks CCNs help in alleviating the problem of spectrum scarcity, but classical sensing and allocation are still energy-consumption intensive, and sensitive to rapid spectrum variations. Our framework which centers on AI driven green CRN aims at integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with other light-weight genetic refinement operations that optimally combine sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution and RIS phase selection. Compared to two baselines, the utilization of MATLAB + NS-3 under dense loads, a traditional CRN with energy sensing under fixed policies, and a hybrid CRN with cooperative sensing under heuristic distribution of resource, there are (25-30%) fewer energy reserves used, sensing AUC greater than 0.90 and +6-13 p.p. higher PDR. The integrated framework is easily scalable to large IoT and vehicular applications, and it provides a feasible and sustainable roadmap to 6G CRNs.

We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation.",2025-12-25,discard,0.72,"While long-document generation scalability is relevant, this work targets diffusion-based text generation—an approach that is not currently a practical foundation for our production RAG/agent/report-generation stack and would likely require training/maintaining a specialized model family.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20715v1,SoK: Speedy Secure Finality,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: While Ethereum has successfully achieved dynamic availability together with safety, a fundamental delay remains between transaction execution and immutable finality. In Ethereum's current Gasper protocol, this latency is on the order of 15 minutes, exposing the network to ex ante reorganization attacks, enabling MEV extraction, and limiting the efficiency of economic settlement. These limitations have motivated a growing body of work on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF), which aims to minimize confirmation latency without weakening formal security guarantees.
  This paper surveys the state of the art in fast finality protocol design. We introduce the core theoretical primitives underlying this space, including reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model, and trace their development from Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. We then analyze the communication and aggregation bottlenecks faced by single-slot finality protocols in large validator settings. Finally, we survey the 3-slot finality (3SF) protocol as a practical synthesis that balances fast finality with the engineering constraints of the Ethereum network.",2025-12-25,discard,0.9,"This is a survey of Ethereum consensus/finality protocol design (SSF, Gasper, 3-slot finality), which is largely orthogonal to our Applied AI priorities (LLM reasoning, agents, RAG, document understanding, and PE diligence workflows).

Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.",2025-12-25,discard,0.86,"This is credible, recent adversarial-ML security work, but it’s highly domain-specific (RF spectrogram-based drone detection and OTA I/Q waveform perturbations) and doesn’t map cleanly to Carlyle’s core Applied AI priorities (LLM reasoning/agents, RAG, document understanding, diligence/report generation).

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20610v2,FedPOD: the deployable units of training for federated learning,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: This paper proposes FedPOD, which ranked first in the 2024 Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) Challenge, for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.",2025-12-25,discard,0.82,"This is primarily a federated learning algorithm paper (tuned/validated on a medical imaging segmentation challenge) focused on communication efficiency and client participation policies—topics that are tangential to our core LLM/agent/RAG/document-understanding workflows for PE due diligence.

arxiv,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20605v2,Emergent temporal abstractions in autoregressive models enable hierarchical reinforcement learning,arXiv,2025-12-23,"Summary: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term ""internal RL"", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.",2025-12-25,pursue,0.78,"This looks highly relevant to agentic planning: it targets the core limitation of token-by-token exploration in autoregressive models and proposes a concrete hierarchical RL mechanism (“internal RL”) that learns temporally-extended controllers/options. If the method is well-specified (architecture, training loop, termination conditions), it could translate to practical macro-action/skill abstractions for tool-using LLM agents and improve learning from sparse, long-horizon rewards—common issues in workflow automation and multi-step reasoning. Even if the experiments are in Gridworld/MuJoCo, the latent-action/control-over-residual-stream idea is novel enough (and very recent) to warrant deeper analysis.",2025-12-26T23:51:12.608553

Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations à la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence.",2025-12-25,discard,0.85,"This appears primarily aimed at functional optimization/PDE solving (PINNs) in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which is largely orthogonal to our near-term needs in LLM reasoning, agent orchestration, RAG, and document understanding for PE workflows.
