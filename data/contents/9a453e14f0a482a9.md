## Summary

The webpage discusses using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a **commonsense knowledge** source for **Large-Scale Task Planning**.

Specifically, it highlights:
*   LLMs can provide a **world model** (commonsense knowledge) in addition to acting as a policy.
*   This world model and policy can be combined within a search algorithm like **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** (MCTS for language models is mentioned).
*   The LLM-induced world model provides a **commonsense prior belief** for MCTS, leading to effective **reasoning**.
*   The LLM-induced policy acts as a heuristic to guide the search, improving efficiency.
*   The proposed **LLM-MCTS** algorithm outperforms MCTS alone and policies induced solely by LLMs (GPT2 and GPT3.5) on complex tasks.
*   The findings suggest that using the LLM as a world model for model-based planning is beneficial when the description length of the world model is substantially smaller than that of the policy (related to **minimum description length (MDL)**).

While the query covers many topics like "chain-of-thought," "self-reflection," "test-time scaling," and "hallucination reduction," the paper directly addresses **planning with LLMs** and **MCTS for language models**, leveraging LLMs for **reasoning** through a world model.

> Large-scale task planning is a major challenge. Recent work exploits large language models (LLMs) directly as a policy and shows surprisingly interesting results. This paper shows that LLMs provide a commonsense model of the world in addition to a policy that acts on it. The world model and the policy can be combined in a search algorithm, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to scale up task planning. In our new LLM-MCTS algorithm, the LLM-induced world model provides a commonsense prior belief for MCTS to achieve effective reasoning; the LLM-induced policy acts as a heuristic to guide the search, vastly improving search efficiency. Experiments show that LLM-MCTS outperforms both MCTS alone and policies induced by LLMs (GPT2 and GPT3.5) by a wide margin, for complex, novel tasks. Further experiments and analyses on multiple tasks -- multiplication, multi-hop travel planning, object rearrangement -- suggest minimum description length (MDL) as a general guiding principle: if the description length of the world model is substantially smaller than that of the policy, using LLM as a world model for model-based planning is likely better than using LLM solely as a policy.
