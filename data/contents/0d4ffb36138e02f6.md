## Summary

The provided webpage discusses an analysis of **plan-based retrieval for grounded text generation**. The core idea is to leverage the **planning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs** to guide retrieval mechanisms, which in turn helps to **reduce the frequency of hallucinations** in generated text. The paper evaluates how improving the coverage of relevant facts through plan-guided retrieval leads to more informative responses with higher attribution to source documents.

While the query covers a broad range of topics related to reasoning and planning in LLMs (including chain-of-thought, MCTS, self-reflection, etc.), this specific paper focuses on using **planning to guide retrieval** as a method for **grounding** and **hallucination reduction/detection**.

**Summary relevant to the query:** The paper addresses **planning with LLMs** and **grounding/hallucination reduction** by using LLM planning capabilities to guide information retrieval for text generation.

**No answer found** for specific details on: Reasoning LLMs (general), chain-of-thought, inference-time compute, self-reflection, MCTS for language models, test-time scaling, or factuality (beyond grounding).

> In text generation, hallucinations refer to the generation of seemingly coherent text that contradicts established knowledge. One compelling hypothesis is that hallucinations occur when a language model is given a generation task outside its parametric knowledge (due to rarity, recency, domain, etc.). A common strategy to address this limitation is to infuse the language models with retrieval mechanisms, providing the model with relevant knowledge for the task. In this paper, we leverage the planning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs and analyze how planning can be used to guide retrieval to further reduce the frequency of hallucinations. We empirically evaluate several variations of our proposed approach on long-form text generation tasks. By improving the coverage of relevant facts, plan-guided retrieval and generation can produce more informative responses while providing a higher rate of attribution to source documents.
