## Summary

The webpage explains how to connect an **MCP (Module Context Protocol) server** to a **Retool Agent**.

**Key points:**

*   **MCP Server:** An open standard introduced by Anthropic that allows LLM-applications (clients) to call tools from a remote system (server).
*   **Functionality:** Connecting an MCP server allows an agent to dynamically retrieve, select, and invoke tools from external data sources (like GitHub, Slack, etc.) provided by the server.
*   **Connection Steps:** You add the MCP server as a new tool within the agent's configuration in Retool, providing the server URL and authentication details if necessary.
*   **Authentication:** Retool supports OAuth 2.0 and Basic Auth for MCP resources.
*   **Protocol Versions:** The page lists supported MCP protocol versions, with the latest being "2025-06-18".
*   **Exposing Local Servers:** Instructions are provided on using tools like `supergateway` and `ngrok` to expose locally running MCP servers (which often run over `stdio`) via an HTTP gateway so Retool can connect to them.

The content directly relates to **agent infrastructure**, **tool use**, and **agent frameworks** (specifically within the Retool ecosystem).

*Model context protocol (MCP)*is an open standard introduced by Anthropic that provides a standard protocol for LLM-applications (clients) to call tools from a remote system (server).
To pull pre-built third-party integrations into your agent as tools from external data sources (such as GitHub, Slack, Cloudflare, Stripe, Docker, etc.), select**Connect to MCP Server**. You can select**Add new resource**from the**Select MCP Server**dropdown if you have not already created an MCP resource. You can configure the**Tool Timeout**for up to 2 minutes maximum.
Retool currently only supports remote-hosted MCPs.
An MCP server dynamically provides a list of tools. It is not a one-time static import from the server into Retool. The tool list is fetched whenever Retool connects to the MCP server.
MCP Server is aresourcetype configured with a URL, but you cannot write queries directly to these resources.
**Key features:**
* Add an MCP server to an agent.
* An agent can retrieve and select tools.
* Agents can invoke one or more of those tools.## Supported authentication[​](#supported-authentication)
Retool supports the following authentication options for MCP resources:
* [OAuth 2.0](https://docs.retool.com/data-sources/guides/authentication/google-oauth)
* [Basic Auth](https://docs.retool.com/data-sources/concepts/authentication#basic)## Supported protocol versions[​](#supported-protocol-versions)
Protocol versions provide a framework to connect MCP resources to clients (such as IDEs, chat interfaces, or other software).
Retool currently supports the following protocol versions:
```
`exportconstLATEST\_PROTOCOL\_VERSION=&quot;2025-06-18&quot;;
exportconstDEFAULT\_NEGOTIATED\_PROTOCOL\_VERSION=&quot;2025-03-26&quot;;
exportconstSUPPORTED\_PROTOCOL\_VERSIONS=[
LATEST\_PROTOCOL\_VERSION,
&quot;2025-03-26&quot;,
&quot;2024-11-05&quot;,
&quot;2024-10-07&quot;,
];
`
```
## Connect to an MCP server[​](#connect-to-an-mcp-server)
Retool Agents can connect to open MCP servers via Streamable HTTP or SSE, as well as private MCP servers using Basic HTTP authentication with a username and password, or OAuth 2.0 with a client ID and client secret.
Many MCP servers are built to run locally over`stdio`. These can be exposed to Retool via an HTTP gateway.
To discover MCP servers that you can connect to, refer to the[official MCP registry](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-09-08-mcp-registry-preview/).
The following sample instructions explain how to use[supergateway](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway)and[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)to create a server URL:
First, use supergateway to start an MCP server that is accessible at`http://localhost:8000/sse`.
```
`npx-ysupergateway--stdio&quot;npx &lt;server package&gt;&quot;--cors
`
```
For example, the[Brave Search MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/brave-search)can be run via the command:
```
`BRAVE\_API\_KEY=... npx-ysupergateway--stdio&quot;npx
@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search&quot;--cors
`
```
Next, use ngrok to tunnel your local MCP server to the internet. Generate a strong password to use for authentication.
```
`ngrok http --basic-auth&#x27;mylongusername:mylongpassword&#x27;8000
`
```
ngrok provides a temporary URL similar to the following:`https://xyz-123.ngrok-free.app`, which is the server&#x27;s base URL. ngrok also supports[static domains](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/free-static-domains-ngrok-users).
If you are using supergateway, your MCP server URL will be`https://xyz-123.ngrok-free.app/sse`, which you can then paste into Retool.
## Connect an MCP server to an agent[​](#connect-an-mcp-server-to-an-agent)
To connect an MCP server to an agent:
1. Open an existing agent or[create a new one](https://docs.retool.com/agents/tutorial).
2. On the**Configuration**tab, click**Add new tool**.
3. Click**Connect to MCP Server**.
4. Select a previously created resource from the**Select MCP Server**dropdown, or choose**Add new resource**.
5. Give the new resource a**Name**.
6. Paste in the URL of your MCP server in the**Server URL**field, and optionally add your authentication credentials.
7. Click**Create resource**.
If your MCP server requires authentication, click**Authenticate MCP Server**from the**Connect to MCP server**page, the**Configuration**tab, or click**Authenticate**in the**Chats**tab. Follow the prompts to**Authenticate**and**Approve**the tool.

Tool authentication required.
The tools exposed by the MCP server will be available as tools on your Retool Agent.
