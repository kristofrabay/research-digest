## [Introduction](#introduction)
Financial due diligence represents a highly resource-intensive, time-consuming and painstakingly manual process, often extending over several weeks or months. This complexity arises from the need for exhaustive, detailed analysis and reasoning across financial datasets, which often require frequent updates.
In our ambitious approach , we&#39;re harnessing**Pathway&#39;s dynamic capabilities**to develop a cutting-edge Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Our goal? To create a solution that autonomously retrieves, analyzes, and synthesizes information from diverse documents—solving real-world challenges efficiently.
Our solution, designed around the core objectives outlined earlier, directly addresses the key pain points of financial due diligence (FDD). It is tailored to serve all of the stakeholders of FDD, from investors to analysts and lawyers, by automating document analysis, accurately responding to queries, and dynamically adapting to changing document datasets. Additionally, it generates summarized, concise FDD reports and quick-look dashboards for targeted firms, offering a strong starting point in the due diligence process. It can also be used independently to perform Q&amp;A on financial documents.

## [Pre-Retrieval and Retrieval](#pre-retrieval-and-retrieval)
![](https://pathway.com/_ipx/w_2560/assets/content/blog/ai-agents-finance-due-diligence/Pre-retrival_Architecture.png)
1. **Pathway’s Real-Time Streaming Framework**
Pathway&#39;s Google Drive connector dynamically streamlines data ingestion into the RAG system, supporting both real-time updates and one-time imports.
2. **Pre-Retrieval Workflow and Data Processing**
Since the documents are mainly in pdf format, we need to have them converted to embeddings before using them for retrieval. For that we have to parse the document, chunk and embed it and finally store it in the vector store.
* **Unstructured’s Parser**: Unstructured.io&#39;s parsing tools excel at extracting structured data from various financial document formats, including tables, lists, and key-value pairs.
* **Agentic Chunker (GPT-4o-mini)**
* Goes beyond standard segmentation by enriching document chunks with contextual metadata.
* Enhances retrieval accuracy by incorporating semantic relationships across different document sections.
* Addresses limitations of traditional retrieval methods by improving nuanced understanding and relevance ranking.
* **OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small**: OpenAI&#39;s text-embedding-3-small model generates vector representations of text, capturing semantic meaning.
* **Pathway’s Vector Store**
* Optimized for storing and retrieving embeddings, enabling efficient similarity search.
* Supports dynamic updates, ensuring the database remains up to date as new financial data is ingested.
* Implements Hybrid Indexing, combining:
* Semantic relevance (vector embeddings).
* Metadata-based filtering (e.g., company name, stock ticker, document date).
* Provides scalability for large financial datasets.
1. **Query Decomposer**: Breaks down complex financial queries into smaller subqueries, allowing retrieval of relevant documents from multiple perspectives.
2. **Cohere Re-ranker**: Assigns a relevance score to each document by understanding the query&#39;s intent, ensuring that the most relevant knowledge base entries are prioritized in responses.## [Post-Retrieval](#post-retrieval)
![](https://pathway.com/_ipx/w_2560/assets/content/blog/ai-agents-finance-due-diligence/Post-Retrival_Agentic_workflow.png)
FA3STER’s post-retrieval phase transforms raw data into highly relevant financial insights using an Agentic-RAG framework powered by LangGraph. This hybrid system integrates specialized agents, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in financial due diligence.

![](https://pathway.com/_ipx/w_2560/assets/content/blog/ai-agents-finance-due-diligence/Vertical-Autonomous-Layer.png)## [Revolutionizing Due Diligence with Vertical Scaling](#revolutionizing-due-diligence-with-vertical-scaling)
Instead of expanding FA3STER horizontally, we introduced a Vertical Autonomous Layer—a self-optimizing intelligence layer that enhances speed, accuracy, and efficiency in financial due diligence. This layer generates a concise FDD report in 10–12 minutes, offering stakeholders a quick yet highly detailed financial assessment. With a processing cost of only ₹15–₹20 ($0.20–$0.25) per report, FA3STER ensures affordable and scalable automation.
## [Key Components of the Autonomous Layer](#key-components-of-the-autonomous-layer)
* **Key Metrics Agent**– Analyzes revenue, profit margins, and growth rates to assess financial health.
* **Business Agent**– Evaluates market conditions, competitive positioning, and risk factors.
* **Executive Agent**– Assesses governance, compliance, and long-term strategic alignment.## [How FA3STER’s Autonomous Layer Works](#how-fa3sters-autonomous-layer-works)
FA3STER’s agents operate in two iterative modes:
1. **Q&amp;A Mode**– Agents generate domain-specific financial queries, retrieving insights using the RAG system.
2. **Discussion Mode**– Agents collaborate, refine findings, and generate new investigative questions to enhance financial accuracy.
The cycle repeats until the majority of agents agree on the accuracy and completeness of the analysis. The final Quick Overview Panel displays summarized insights, making it easy for stakeholders to interact with key financial data instantly.
## [Results and Metrics](#results-and-metrics)
For evaluation, we use 2 datasets:
* [FinQABench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lighthouzai/finqabench):
* Based on Apple’s 2022 10K SEC filing, containing 100 test cases with financial queries and expected responses.
* Used to assess accuracy, hallucination prevention, and response quality in financial AI systems.
We compared the performance of the following workflows on this dataset:
* Naive RAG without Agentic Contextual Chunking
* Naive RAG with Agentic Contextual Chunking
|Workflow|Context Precision|Context Recall|Response Relevancy|Faithfulness|Factual Correctness|
Naive RAG with Agentic Chunking|0.904|0.849|0.928|0.901|0.518|
Naive RAG without Agentic Chunking|0.801|0.782|0.883|0.828|0.449|
It is clear from the results that the performance is enhanced by Agentic Chunking.
* [SEC 10-Q dataset](https://github.com/docugami/KG-RAG-datasets/tree/main/sec-10-q):
* Includes four AAPL 10-Q filings and 39 complex financial queries requiring multi-step reasoning.
* Designed to stress-test retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models for multi-document financial analysis.
Here, we compared the following workflows:
* OpenParser with Self-RAG[[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)
* OpenParser with Naive-RAG
* Our Post-Retrieval Agentic Workflow with Contextual Chunking
* Unstructured Parser with Naive-RAG
* Unstructured Parser with Self-RAG
It can be observed that Our Post-Retrieval Agentic Workflow with Contextual Chunking outperforms other methods by a significant margin. This shows the efficiency and enhanced performance of our Post-Retrieval Agentic Workflow on datasets which require reasoning over multiple documents in order to answer queries. In particular, improved Factual Correctness and Faithfulness are much needed in Financial Due Diligence, as it indicates that hallucination is minimized and information is preserved.
The following metrics from**RAGAS**[[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15217)were used for evaluation:
1. **[Context Precision](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/context_precision/)**: Measures how many retrieved chunks are relevant to the query. Higher is better.
2. **[Context Recall](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/context_recall/)**: Assesses the proportion of relevant documents successfully retrieved
3. **[Response Relevancy](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/answer_relevance/)**: Evaluates how well the generated answer matches the query intent.
4. **[Faithfulness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/faithfulness/)**: Ensures responses remain factually consistent with retrieved data.
5. **[Factual Correctness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/factual_correctness/)**: Compares answers to ground truth financial data for accuracy.
|Workflow|Context Precision|Context Recall|Response Relevancy|Faithfulness|Factual Correctness|
OpenParser with Self-RAG|0.524|0.272|0.364|0.659|0.280|
OpenParser with Naive-RAG|0.521|0.253|0.374|0.623|0.273|
Unstructured Parser with Self-RAG|0.499|0.259|0.269|0.596|0.269|
Unstructured Parser with Naive-RAG|0.524|0.313|0.319|0.503|0.276|
Our Workflow|0.690|0.396|0.701|0.788|0.384|
## [Resilience to Error Handling:](#resilience-to-error-handling)
Our Financial Agentic RAG system incorporates robust error management, ensuring uninterrupted functionality. This enhances resilience by enabling quick recovery from failures, rapid error identification, and timely debugging and resolution.
**Tool-Specific Fallbacks**: Key tools have designated backups, such as web search stepping in for API failures or alternative tools in the Finance Agent.
For example: When the relevant data is not retrieved from the primary data source, Finance Agent falls back to tools like Tavily and if that too fails, it falls back to open source web searches like duck duck go, further fallback details have been mentioned in the appendix.
**Error Handling**: Nested try and except blocks to manage failures effectively.
Fallback Mechanisms, extensive logging is implemented to ensure traceability. When a fallback is triggered, the callback function raises a warning to facilitate tracking and debugging.
**Avoiding Exponential Back-Off**: Excluded exponential back-off to maintain query speed, as most tool failures were observed to be binary.

Our AI architecture incorporates robust guardrails to ensure secure, ethical, and compliant interactions. These safeguards block irrelevant queries, including defamation, privacy violations, hate speech, and intellectual property concerns, upholding privacy and ethical standards.
**Llamaguard’s Safety guardrail**[[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06674):
* Powered by Llama-3.1 8B, Llamaguard classifies queries as safe or unsafe.
* Detects 14 predefined risk categories (e.g., privacy violations, hate speech, defamation).
* Ensures secure and compliance-driven user interactions.
**PII Guardrail**[[5]](https://www.guardrailsai.com/docs/examples/check_for_pii):
* Initially explored Guardrail.ai with Presidio Analyzer &amp; Anonymizer for PII detection.
* Found the approach unnecessary and resource-intensive, leading to its removal for workflow optimization.
**Transparency through Socket Communication**:
* FA3STER’s backend and frontend are connected via socket communication to track query execution in real time.
