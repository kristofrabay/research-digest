## Summary

The provided webpage describes the **Mcp Server Toolhouse**, which is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server built on Toolhouse and Groq's API.

**Key points relevant to your query:**

*   **MCP Servers:** The page is entirely about an MCP server implementation.
*   **Tool Use:** The server allows compatible MCP Clients (like the Claude Desktop App) to access a vast library of **tools** (e.g., Scrape the web, Memory, Send Email) provided by the Toolhouse platform.
*   **Agent Infrastructure Components (Not explicitly detailed, but related concepts are present):**
    *   The core function is enabling LLM applications to connect with external data sources and tools, which is a fundamental aspect of agent infrastructure.
    *   The mention of "Memory" as an available tool suggests support for agent memory concepts.

**Components from your query that are NOT mentioned or detailed on this page:**

*   agentic memory (only "Memory" tool is listed)
*   agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents SDK, Anthropic Agents SDK, Google SDK)
*   function calling
*   structured outputs
*   agent orchestration

**Summary:**

The Mcp Server Toolhouse is an MCP server that facilitates **tool use** for LLM applications by connecting them to tools available on the Toolhouse platform. It is an example of an **MCP server** infrastructure component. It mentions a "Memory" tool, suggesting support for basic **agent memory**. However, it does not provide details on specific agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.), function calling, structured outputs, or agent orchestration.

Information
## Toolhouse MCP Server
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toolhouse-community/mcp-server-toolhouse/main/assets/mcp-server-toolhouse-banner.svg "Toolhouse MCP Server implementation")
This MCP server allows you to connect MCP clients with Toolhouse’s tools. Built on top of[Toolhouse](https://toolhouse.ai/)and Groq’s API - for fast inference.
[The Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you’re building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

## Features
* Allows compatible MCP Clients (i.e Claude Desktop App) to access a vast library of tools to enhance their capabilities## Configuration
### Setup Environment Variables
1. **Toolhouse API Key**:
You need a Toolhouse API Key to access the Toolhouse platform.
* Sign up at[Toolhouse](https://toolhouse.ai/)and create an account, it’s FREE to get started.
* Obtain your API key from the Toolhouse dashboard.
* **Toolhouse Bundle**:
You need to create a bundle, essentially a group of tools you can assemble from the ones available on the Toolhouse platform.
* Navigate to[Toolhouse Bundles]()and create a bundle with any name i.e.`mcp-toolhouse`
* Add the tools that you want to use on your client i.e. Scrape the web, Memory, Send Email
* Ensure your bundle looks good (it auto saves)
* (Optional) Set these environment variables if you prefer not having them in the configuration:
```
`exportTOOLHOUSE\_API\_KEY=&quot;&quot;your\_toolhouse\_api\_key&quot;&quot;exportTOOLHOUSE\_BUNDLE=&quot;&quot;your\_bundle\_name&quot;&quot;`
```
### Starting the server
> > [!TIP]If you are stuck configuring your client, i.e. Cursor, Windsurf, Cline etc… open an Issue here on Github and I will help you personally.
> Add this server to your client’s configuration.
For example on Claude’s desktop app navigate to the folder and manually change the settings file called`claude\_desktop\_config.json`
On MacOS:
```
`\~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude\_desktop\_config.json`
```
On Windows:
```
`%APPDATA%/Claude/claude\_desktop\_config.json`
```
Modify the configuration file to look like this:
## With UVX
```
`{&quot;mcpServers&quot;:{&quot;mcp-server-toolhouse&quot;:{&quot;command&quot;:&quot;uvx&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:[&quot;&quot;mcp\_server\_toolhouse&quot;&quot;],&quot;env&quot;:{&quot;&quot;TOOLHOUSE\_API\_KEY&quot;&quot;:&quot;&quot;your\_toolhouse\_api\_key&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;TOOLHOUSE\_BUNDLE&quot;&quot;:&quot;&quot;a\_bundle\_name&quot;&quot;}}}}`
```
## With UV
```
`{&quot;mcpServers&quot;:{&quot;mcp-server-toolhouse&quot;:{&quot;command&quot;:&quot;uv&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:[&quot;--directory&quot;,&quot;/path/to/this/folder/mcp-server-toolhouse&quot;,&quot;run&quot;,&quot;&quot;mcp\_server\_toolhouse&quot;&quot;],&quot;env&quot;:{&quot;&quot;TOOLHOUSE\_API\_KEY&quot;&quot;:&quot;&quot;your\_toolhouse\_api\_key&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;TOOLHOUSE\_BUNDLE&quot;&quot;:&quot;&quot;a\_bundle\_name&quot;&quot;}}}}`
```
### Run this project locally
This project is not yet configured for ephemeral environments like`uvx`. Run the project locally by cloning the repository:
```
`gitclonehttps://github.com/toolhouse-community/mcp-server-toolhouse.git`
```
Add this tool as an MCP server.
On MacOS:
```
`\~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude\_desktop\_config.json`
```
On Windows:
```
`%APPDATA%/Claude/claude\_desktop\_config.json`
```
Modify the configuration file to include:
```
`&quot;toolhouse&quot;:{&quot;command&quot;:&quot;uv&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:[&quot;--directory&quot;,&quot;/path/to/this/repo/&quot;,&quot;run&quot;,&quot;mcp-server-toolhouse&quot;],&quot;env&quot;:{&quot;&quot;TOOLHOUSE\_API\_KEY&quot;&quot;:&quot;&quot;your\_toolhouse\_api\_key&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;TOOLHOUSE\_BUNDLE&quot;&quot;:&quot;&quot;a\_bundle\_name&quot;&quot;}}`
```
## TODO
Future improvements include:
* Adding test coverage for all modules
* Extending API support for enhanced tool configurations## Debugging
Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging experience, use the[MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).
Launch the Inspector via[`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm):
```
`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/toolhouse\_mcp run toolhouse-mcp`
```
The Inspector will display a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
