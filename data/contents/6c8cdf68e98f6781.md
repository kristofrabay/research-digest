## Summary

The webpage describes the **LangChain Integration MCP server**, which allows **LangChain-powered applications** to use **MCP tools** (Model Context Protocol) for controlled interaction with local resources like the filesystem.

Key points relevant to your query:

*   **Agent Infrastructure/Frameworks:** It specifically integrates with **LangChain** to provide **tool calling capabilities**.
*   **Tool Use/Function Calling:** The MCP server acts as a tool that language models can invoke (e.g., to read files).
*   **MCP Servers:** The core topic is setting up and using this specific MCP server (`langchain-mcp`).
*   **Integration:** Instructions are provided for integrating this server with specific AI environments like **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **Claude Desktop**.

The page **does not** explicitly detail:
*   MCP servers in general beyond this specific LangChain integration.
*   Agent memory or agentic memory concepts.
*   OpenAI Agents SDK, Anthropic Agents SDK, or Google SDK.
*   Agent orchestration.
*   Structured outputs (though tool use implies structured interaction).

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is a tool that allows language models to interact with your local filesystem and other resources in a controlled manner. It integrates with LangChain to provide tool calling capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol.
## Installation
You can install the`langchain-mcp`package using pip:
```
`pip install langchain-mcp`
```
For better dependency management, you may want to use a tool like`uv`:
```
`uv pip install langchain-mcp`
```
## Setting Up the MCP Server
To use the MCP server, you need to create an`MCPToolkit`instance with an MCP client session. Here's a basic example of how to set it up:
```
`from langchain\_mcp import MCPToolkit
import mcp
# Create an MCP client session
session = mcp.ClientSession(...)
# Create the toolkit and initialize it
toolkit = MCPToolkit(session)
await toolkit.initialize()
# Get the available tools
tools = toolkit.get\_tools()`
```
### Environment Configuration
When using certain LLM providers like Groq, you'll need to set up your API keys as environment variables:
```
`export GROQ\_API\_KEY=your\_api\_key\_here`
```
## Using the MCP Server
Here's a complete example of how to use the MCP toolkit with LangChain:
```
`import asyncio
import os
from langchain\_groq import ChatGroq
from langchain\_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langchain\_mcp import MCPToolkit
import mcp
async def main():
# Set up the LLM
llm = ChatGroq(model\_name=&quot;&quot;llama-3.1-8b-instant&quot;&quot;)
# Create an MCP session
session = mcp.ClientSession(...)
# Initialize the toolkit
toolkit = MCPToolkit(session)
await toolkit.initialize()
# Get the tools
tools = toolkit.get\_tools()
# Create a message with a user query
message = HumanMessage(content=&quot;&quot;Read and summarize the file ./LICENSE&quot;&quot;)
# Invoke the LLM with the tools
response = await llm.ainvoke([message], tools=tools)
print(response.content)
if \_\_name\_\_ == &quot;&quot;\_\_main\_\_&quot;&quot;:
asyncio.run(main())`
```
## Running the Demo
A demo script is included that showcases how to use the MCP server to read files from your local filesystem:
```
`export GROQ\_API\_KEY=xxx
uv run tests/demo.py &quot;&quot;Read and summarize the file ./LICENSE&quot;&quot;`
```
When you run this command, you should see output similar to:
```
`Secure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio
Allowed directories: [ '/path/to/your/directory' ]
The file ./LICENSE is a MIT License agreement. It states that the software is provided &quot;as is&quot; without warranty...`
```
## Security Considerations
The MCP server provides access to your filesystem, so it's important to properly configure the allowed directories to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files. By default, the demo only allows access to the current working directory.
## How to install this MCP server
### For Claude Code
To add this MCP server to Claude Code, run this command in your terminal:
```
`claude mcp add-json "langchain-mcp" '{&quot;&quot;command&quot;&quot;:&quot;&quot;python&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;args&quot;&quot;:[&quot;&quot;-m&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;langchain\_mcp.stdio\_server&quot;&quot;]}'`
```
See the[official Claude Code MCP documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)for more details.
### For Cursor
There are two ways to add an MCP server to Cursor. The most common way is to add the server globally in the`\~/.cursor/mcp.json`file so that it is available in all of your projects.
If you only need the server in a single project, you can add it to the project instead by creating or adding it to the`.cursor/mcp.json`file.
#### Adding an MCP server to Cursor globally
To add a global MCP server go to Cursor Settings \> Tools & Integ& Integrations and click "New MCP Server".
When you click that button the`\~/.cursor/mcp.json`file will be opened and you can add your server like this:
```
`{
&quot;&quot;mcpServers&quot;&quot;: {
&quot;&quot;langchain-mcp&quot;&quot;: {
&quot;&quot;command&quot;&quot;: &quot;&quot;python&quot;&quot;,
&quot;&quot;args&quot;&quot;: [
&quot;&quot;-m&quot;&quot;,
&quot;&quot;langchain\_mcp.stdio\_server&quot;&quot;
]
}
}
}`
```
#### Adding an MCP server to a project
To add an MCP server to a project you can create a new`.cursor/mcp.json`file or add it to the existing one. This will look exactly the same as the global MCP server example above.
#### How to use the MCP server
Once the server is installed, you might need to head back to Settings \> MCP and click the refresh button.
The Cursor agent will then be able to see the available tools the added MCP server has available and will call them when it needs to.
You can also explicitly ask the agent to use the tool by mentioning the tool name and describing what the function does.
### For Claude Desktop
To add this MCP server to Claude Desktop:
1. Find your configuration file:
* **macOS**:`\~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude\_desktop\_config.json`
* **Windows**:`%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude\_desktop\_config.json`
* **Linux**:`\~/.config/Claude/claude\_desktop\_config.json`
2. Add this to your configuration file:
```
`{
&quot;&quot;mcpServers&quot;&quot;: {
&quot;&quot;langchain-mcp&quot;&quot;: {
&quot;&quot;command&quot;&quot;: &quot;&quot;python&quot;&quot;,
&quot;&quot;args&quot;&quot;: [
&quot;&quot;-m&quot;&quot;,
&quot;&quot;langchain\_mcp.stdio\_server&quot;&quot;
]
}
}
}`
```
3. Restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect
