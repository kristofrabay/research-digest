## Summary

The provided web page focuses on **Debugging MCP Servers** using the **MCP Inspector**, an external developer tool for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Framework**.

The summary of the page content is:

The MCP Inspector allows users to test and debug MCP servers through a user interface. It can be run via `npx` and allows customization of client UI and proxy server ports. The Inspector features tabs for:
*   **Server Connection:** Viewing status, capabilities, and metadata.
*   **Testing Tools:** Viewing schemas, testing tools with custom inputs, and reviewing results.
*   **Inspecting Resources:** Browsing resources, viewing metadata, and testing retrieval/subscriptions.
*   **Testing Prompts:** Viewing templates and testing prompts with different arguments.

The page also details how to use **Framework Logging** within the MCP Framework, including different log levels, and outlines a **Development Workflow** involving iterative testing and monitoring logs. Finally, it lists **Common Issues** related to tools, resources, and prompts, along with **Best Practices** for logging, error handling, and performance monitoring.

**No answer found** for the specific terms in your query related to general agent infrastructure concepts like "tool use," "agent memory," "agent frameworks," "LangChain," "LlamaIndex," "OpenAI Agents SDK," "Anthropic Agents SDK," "Google SDK," "function calling," "structured outputs," or "agent orchestration," as the page is exclusively about debugging the MCP Framework.

# Debugging MCP Servers
tip
The Model Context Protocol provides an open-source Inspector tool that makes debugging your MCP servers easy!
## MCP Inspector[​](#mcp-inspector)
The MCP Inspector is an external developer tool maintained by the Model Context Protocol team that helps you test and debug MCP servers. It provides a user interface for interacting with your server and testing your tools, resources, and prompts.
### Using the Inspector[​](#using-the-inspector)
You can run the Inspector directly through`npx`without installation:
```
`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector &lt;path-to-your-server&gt;
`
```
For example, if you&#x27;ve built your MCP Framework server:
```
`# First build your server
npm run build
# Then run the inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/index.js
`
```
### Customizing Ports[​](#customizing-ports)
The Inspector runs both a client UI (default port 5173) and an MCP proxy server (default port 3000). You can customize these ports if needed:
```
`CLIENT\_PORT=8080 SERVER\_PORT=9000 npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/index.js
`
```
## Using the Inspector[​](#using-the-inspector-1)
### Server Connection[​](#server-connection)
When you open the Inspector in your browser, you&#x27;ll see:
* Connection status to your server
* Server capabilities
* Server metadata### Testing Tools[​](#testing-tools)
The Tools tab allows you to:
* View all registered tools
* See tool schemas and descriptions
* Test tools with custom inputs
* View execution results
Example testing workflow:
1. Select your tool from the list
2. Enter test inputs in the JSON editor
3. Execute the tool
4. Review the response### Inspecting Resources[​](#inspecting-resources)
The Resources tab enables you to:
* Browse available resources
* View resource metadata
* Test resource content retrieval
* Test subscriptions (if supported)### Testing Prompts[​](#testing-prompts)
In the Prompts tab, you can:
* View available prompt templates
* Test prompts with different arguments
* Preview generated messages## Framework Logging[​](#framework-logging)
MCP Framework includes built-in logging that integrates well with the Inspector:
```
`import{logger}from&quot;mcp-framework&quot;;
classMyToolextendsMCPTool{
asyncexecute(input){
logger.info(&quot;Starting execution&quot;);
try{
constresult=awaitthis.process(input);
logger.info(&quot;Execution successful&quot;);
returnresult;
}catch(error){
logger.error(&quot;Execution failed:&quot;,error);
throwerror;
}
}
}
`
```
### Log Levels[​](#log-levels)
```
`logger.debug(&quot;Detailed information&quot;);
logger.info(&quot;General information&quot;);
logger.warn(&quot;Warning messages&quot;);
logger.error(&quot;Error messages&quot;);
`
```
## Development Workflow[​](#development-workflow)
1. **Start Development**
* Launch your server with the Inspector
* Verify basic connectivity
* Check that your tools are listed
* **Iterative Testing**
* Make changes to your server
* Rebuild (`npm run build`)
* Reconnect the Inspector
* Test the changes
* Monitor the logs
* **Test Edge Cases**
* Try invalid inputs
* Test error handling
* Check concurrent operations## Common Issues[​](#common-issues)
### Tool Not Found[​](#tool-not-found)
* Ensure the tool is properly exported
* Check that the tool name matches
* Verify the tool is being loaded by the server### Resource Errors[​](#resource-errors)
* Check resource URI formatting
* Verify resource read implementation
* Test subscription cleanup### Prompt Issues[​](#prompt-issues)
* Validate prompt arguments
* Check message generation
* Verify resource references## Best Practices[​](#best-practices)
1. **Use Descriptive Logging**
```
`logger.info(`Processing request for user${userId}`);
logger.error(`Failed to fetch data:${error.message}`);
`
```
1. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
```
`try{
// Your operation
}catch(error){
logger.error(`Operation failed:${error.message}`);
thrownewError(`Failed to complete operation:${error.message}`);
}
`
```
1. **Monitor Performance**
```
`conststart=Date.now();
// ... operation ...
logger.debug(`Operation took${Date.now()-start}ms`);
`
