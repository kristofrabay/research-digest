## Summary

The provided webpage describes **THOUGHTSCULPT**, a general reasoning and search method for tasks where outputs can be broken down into components.

Key aspects relevant to your query include:

*   **Reasoning and Search:** THOUGHTSCULPT explores a search tree of potential solutions using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**.
*   **Intermediate Revision:** A critical feature is the inclusion of **revision actions** in the action space, allowing the model to revise previous output components rather than just continuing to build the solution.

While the paper focuses on a specific reasoning method (THOUGHTSCULPT using MCTS and revision), it directly addresses concepts related to **Reasoning LLMs**, **MCTS for language models**, and **planning with LLMs** (as MCTS is a planning technique). It does not explicitly mention chain-of-thought, inference-time compute, self-reflection, test-time scaling, hallucination reduction/detection, grounding, or factuality.

> We present THOUGHTSCULPT, a general reasoning and search method for tasks with outputs that can be decomposed into components. THOUGHTSCULPT explores a search tree of potential solutions using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), building solutions one action at a time and evaluating according to any domain-specific heuristic, which in practice is often simply an LLM evaluator. Critically, our action space includes revision actions: THOUGHTSCULPT may choose to revise part of its previous output rather than continuing to build the rest of its output. Empirically, THOUGHTSCULPT outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning methods across three challenging tasks: Story Outline Improvement (up to +30% interestingness), Mini-Crosswords Solving (up to +16% word success rate), and Constrained Generation (up to +10% concept coverage).
