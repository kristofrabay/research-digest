## Summary

The webpage describes **M3DocRAG**, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed for understanding multi-page and multi-document contexts.

Key aspects relevant to your query include:

*   **Multi-modal RAG:** It uses a multi-modal retriever and a Multi-modal Language Model (MLM) to handle various document contexts and question types (single-hop and multi-hop).
*   **Handling Visual Information:** It preserves visual information, addressing the limitation of text-based RAG methods that rely solely on OCR and ignore visual elements like figures, charts, and tables.
*   **Document Understanding:** It is designed to answer questions that require information across different pages or documents, which is difficult for standard MLMs that have limited context windows.
*   **Vision Models Mentioned:** The framework achieves superior performance using models like **ColPali** and **Qwen2-VL 7B** (a vision-language model).

While the page focuses on a specific RAG framework (M3DocRAG) and a new benchmark (M3DocVQA), it directly relates to **Vision-language models**, **multimodal RAG**, and **document understanding** (including handling charts/figures). It does not explicitly detail report generation with LLMs, PDF parsing tools, or mention GPT-4V, Claude vision, or Gemini by name, though the underlying concepts are related to the broader field you listed.

> Document visual question answering (DocVQA) pipelines that answer questions from documents have broad applications. Existing methods focus on handling single-page documents with multi-modal language models (MLMs), or rely on text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that uses text extraction tools such as optical character recognition (OCR). However, there are difficulties in applying these methods in real-world scenarios: (a) questions often require information across different pages or documents, where MLMs cannot handle many long documents; (b) documents often have important information in visual elements such as figures, but text extraction tools ignore them. We introduce M3DocRAG, a novel multi-modal RAG framework that flexibly accommodates various document contexts (closed-domain and open-domain), question hops (single-hop and multi-hop), and evidence modalities (text, chart, figure, etc.). M3DocRAG finds relevant documents and answers questions using a multi-modal retriever and an MLM, so that it can efficiently handle single or many documents while preserving visual information. Since previous DocVQA datasets ask questions in the context of a specific document, we also present M3DocVQA, a new benchmark for evaluating open-domain DocVQA over 3,000+ PDF documents with 40,000+ pages. In three benchmarks (M3DocVQA/MMLongBench-Doc/MP-DocVQA), empirical results show that M3DocRAG with ColPali and Qwen2-VL 7B achieves superior performance than many strong baselines, including state-of-the-art performance in MP-DocVQA. We provide comprehensive analyses of different indexing, MLMs, and retrieval models. Lastly, we qualitatively show that M3DocRAG can successfully handle various scenarios, such as when relevant information exists across multiple pages and when answer evidence only exists in images.
