## Summary

The webpage describes **FinTeam**, a multi-agent collaborative intelligence system designed for comprehensive financial scenarios. It utilizes four specialized LLM agents—document analyzer, analyst, accountant, and consultant—trained with specific financial expertise to handle complex financial report generation tasks, ranging from macro- to micro-economics analysis and extensive data analysis. The system was evaluated on tasks derived from real online investment forums, achieving a 62.00% acceptance rate for generated financial reports, outperforming baseline models like GPT-4o and Xuanyuan.

The user query asks about **agents and finance**, specifically mentioning: multi-agent systems for finance, private equity, venture capital, due diligence automation, investment opportunity analysis, deal sourcing, portfolio monitoring, agents for data analysis, financial report generation, and integrations with PitchBook, AlphaSense, Preqin, CapIQ, and Bloomberg.

**Summary relative to the query:**

FinTeam is a **multi-agent system for finance** focused on **financial report generation** and **data analysis** within comprehensive financial scenarios. It demonstrates superior performance in these areas compared to baseline models.

However, the text **does not mention** private equity, venture capital, due diligence automation, deal sourcing, portfolio monitoring, or specific integrations with PitchBook, AlphaSense, Preqin, CapIQ, or Bloomberg.

**Conclusion:** The page partially answers the query by confirming the existence and success of a multi-agent system for financial analysis and report generation, but it lacks information on the specific private equity/VC applications and external platform integrations mentioned in the query.

> Financial report generation tasks range from macro- to micro-economics analysis, also requiring extensive data analysis. Existing LLM models are usually fine-tuned on simple QA tasks and cannot comprehensively analyze real financial scenarios. Given the complexity, financial companies often distribute tasks among departments. Inspired by this, we propose FinTeam, a financial multi-agent collaborative system, with a workflow with four LLM agents: document analyzer, analyst, accountant, and consultant. We train these agents with specific financial expertise using constructed datasets. We evaluate FinTeam on comprehensive financial tasks constructed from real online investment forums, including macroeconomic, industry, and company analysis. The human evaluation shows that by combining agents, the financial reports generate from FinTeam achieved a 62.00% acceptance rate, outperforming baseline models like GPT-4o and Xuanyuan. Additionally, FinTeam&#39;s agents demonstrate a 7.43% average improvement on FinCUGE and a 2.06% accuracy boost on FinEval. Project is available at [> this https URL
