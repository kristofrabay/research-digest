![Top 10 Open-Source AI Agent Frameworks](https://apipie.ai/docs/img/Blog/May/AI-Frameworks.png)
AI agent frameworks have exploded in popularity as developers shift from simply calling LLMs to building autonomous systems that can reason, plan, use tools, and even collaborate with other agents. The past year has seen remarkable innovation in this space, with new frameworks emerging to address different aspects of agent development.
Whether you&#x27;re building a RAG-based assistant, a multi-agent research system, or enterprise AI workflows, finding the right framework is crucial. This guide compares the top open-source AI agent frameworks of 2025, analyzing their architectures, capabilities, and optimal use cases.
## What Makes a Great AI Agent Framework?[​](#what-makes-a-great-ai-agent-framework)
Modern AI agent frameworks provide the infrastructure for language models to:
* **Plan and reason**about complex tasks
* **Use tools and external APIs**(function calling)
* **Maintain memory**across interactions
* **Manage workflows**with error handling and retry logic
* **Collaborate**with other agents in multi-agent systems
* **Connect to data sources**for retrieval-augmented generation
Let&#x27;s examine how the top frameworks deliver these capabilities.
## The Top 10 AI Agent Frameworks[​](#the-top-10-ai-agent-frameworks)
### 1.[AG2 (formerly AutoGen)](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2)-[APIpie Integration Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/AutoGen)[​](#1-ag2-formerly-autogen---apipie-integration-guide)
**Language:**Python
**Agent Style:**Multi-agent conversation framework
**Execution Logic:**Event-driven, asynchronous
**Memory Support:**Conversation context, extensible
**Tool Use:**Flexible, delegated to specialized agents
**Notable Features:**Multi-agent collaboration, tool integration, code execution
**Why it Stands Out:**AG2 revolutionizes agent design by framing everything as a*conversation among specialized agents*. Instead of a single agent loop, you create multiple agents (e.g., an assistant, a user proxy, a coding agent) that communicate asynchronously to solve complex tasks.
With AG2&#x27;s event-driven architecture, agents can work concurrently rather than sequentially, reducing bottlenecks in multi-step workflows. The framework supports human-in-the-loop workflows for oversight and feedback, allowing for both autonomous operation and human guidance when needed.
AG2 is particularly strong for scenarios involving collaborative problem-solving, like a dialogue between a planning agent and an execution agent, or a research task where different agents contribute specialized knowledge. Its flexible design allows for customizable agent behaviors through system messages and specialized configurations.
**GitHub:**[ag2ai/ag2](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2)
### 2.[CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)-[APIpie Integration Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/CrewAI)[​](#2-crewai---apipie-integration-guide)
**Language:**Python
**Agent Style:**Role-based, collaborative teams
**Execution Logic:**Dynamic self-organization or scripted flows
**Memory Support:**Shared crew context, built-in memory modules
**Tool Use:**Python functions, API integrations
**Notable Features:**Role-based collaboration, enterprise control plane
**Why it Stands Out:**CrewAI&#x27;s greatest strength is its intuitive approach to multi-agent orchestration. By using the metaphor of a &quot;crew&quot; with different roles, it makes complex agent interactions approachable. You can define agents with roles like &quot;Researcher,&quot; &quot;Writer,&quot; and &quot;Critic,&quot; then let them collaborate to solve tasks.
CrewAI offers two modes: self-organizing crews (where agents determine their own collaboration patterns) and explicit CrewAI Flows (where you script exact interactions). This flexibility makes it suitable for both exploratory research and production applications.
With 30,000+ GitHub stars and a growing community of certified developers, CrewAI has become the framework of choice for creative, multi-perspective agent systems.
**GitHub:**[crewAIInc/crewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)
### 3.[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)&amp;[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)-[APIpie Langchain Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/Langchain)|[APIpie LangGraph Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/LangGraph)[​](#3-langchain--langgraph---apipie-langchain-guide--apipie-langgraph-guide)
**Language:**Python (JS version available)
**Agent Style:**Component library (LangChain) + Graph-based agent pathways (LangGraph)
**Execution Logic:**Chains &amp; callbacks (LangChain), Directed acyclic graph (DAG) (LangGraph)
**Memory Support:**Multiple memory types, persistent context, checkpoint APIs
**Tool Use:**Extensive tool library, custom tools, agent executors
**Notable Features:**Massive ecosystem, visual graph design, checkpointing, deterministic flows
**Why it Stands Out:**The LangChain ecosystem provides both foundational components (LangChain) and advanced orchestration capabilities (LangGraph). LangChain offers the largest ecosystem of tools, components, and integrations in the LLM space, while LangGraph extends this foundation with graph-based reasoning.
Built on top of LangChain, LangGraph represents agent reasoning steps as nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This unlocks powerful patterns like parallel processing, conditional branching, and explicit error handling. Its deterministic control flow eliminates randomness in operation order, making debugging and testing more straightforward.
For complex workflows where reliability matters, the LangChain+LangGraph combination stands apart. The framework supports streaming of both final answers and intermediate steps, providing transparency into the agent&#x27;s thinking process. With the entire LangChain component library available as building blocks, this ecosystem offers unparalleled flexibility.
Companies like Replit, Uber, and Klarna use these frameworks for production applications where certainty, auditability, and access to a rich ecosystem of components are critical.
**GitHub:**[langchain-ai/langgraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)|[langchain-ai/langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
### 4.[OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python)-[APIpie Integration Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/OpenAI-Agents)[​](#4-openai-agents-sdk---apipie-integration-guide)
**Language:**Python
**Agent Style:**Function-calling, agent handoffs
**Execution Logic:**Structured workflows, triage patterns
**Memory Support:**Context management, result storage
**Tool Use:**Python functions, first-class function calling
**Notable Features:**Guardrails, agent handoffs, OpenAI integration
**Why it Stands Out:**As OpenAI&#x27;s official agent framework, this SDK provides the most seamless integration with GPT-4 and other OpenAI models. It focuses on production readiness with features like guardrails (content filtering, output validation) and standardized patterns for agent-to-agent handoffs.
The SDK emphasizes a lightweight architecture centered on function calling. Instead of complex abstractions, it provides a clean runtime to manage the prompt, function schema, and callbacks, making it accessible to developers already familiar with OpenAI&#x27;s API.
With nearly 10,000 GitHub stars despite being released only in March 2025, the OpenAI Agents SDK is rapidly becoming the standard for production deployments leveraging OpenAI&#x27;s models.
**GitHub:**[openai/openai-agents-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python)
### 5.[Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://github.com/google/adk-python)-[APIpie Integration Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/Google-ADK)[​](#5-google-agent-development-kit-adk---apipie-integration-guide)
**Language:**Python
**Agent Style:**Workflow agents, LLM agents
**Execution Logic:**Sequential, Loop, Parallel agents
**Memory Support:**State management, persistent agents
**Tool Use:**OpenAPI specs, Google Cloud tools, MCP
**Notable Features:**A2A protocol, structured workflows, GCP integration
**Why it Stands Out:**Google&#x27;s ADK provides explicit constructs for complex workflow orchestration. With first-class support for Sequential, Loop, and Parallel agents, it offers unparalleled control over multi-step agent processes.
ADK excels at enterprise integration, with built-in support for OpenAPI specifications as tools and secure authentication for accessing external APIs. Its integration with Google Cloud Platform makes it ideal for teams already using GCP services.
As the same toolkit used internally for Google&#x27;s &quot;Gemini&quot; AI Apps, ADK brings enterprise-grade agent capabilities to open source. Its support for the emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol positions it well for future interoperability.
**GitHub:**[google/adk-python](https://github.com/google/adk-python)
### 6.[Microsoft Semantic Kernel (SK)](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)-[APIpie Integration Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/Semantic-Kernel)[​](#6-microsoft-semantic-kernel-sk---apipie-integration-guide)
**Language:**C# and Python (multi-language SDK)
**Agent Style:**Skills-based, plugin architecture
**Execution Logic:**Planner with skills orchestration
**Memory Support:**Rich abstractions (semantic, volatile, persistent)
**Tool Use:**Native functions, OpenAPI specs, skills
**Notable Features:**Multi-language support, enterprise integration
**Why it Stands Out:**Semantic Kernel stands apart with its conventional programming approach to AI agents. Instead of reinventing software architecture, SK treats AI as a natural extension of existing programming paradigms, making it accessible to enterprise developers.
SK&#x27;s plugin architecture organizes functionality into &quot;Skills&quot; –reusable modules of AI or native functions that can be composed. This encourages clean separation of concerns and reusability across projects. Its planning capabilities can automatically chain these skills to accomplish complex tasks.
With first-class support for C#, Python, and Java, SK caters to enterprise development teams working across multiple languages. Its integration with Azure services makes it particularly attractive for Microsoft-centric organizations.
**GitHub:**[microsoft/semantic-kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
### 7.[Hugging Face SmolAgents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)-[APIpie Integration Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/Smolagents)[​](#7-hugging-face-smolagents---apipie-integration-guide)
**Language:**Python
**Agent Style:**Code-generating reflexive agents
**Execution Logic:**&quot;Thinking in code&quot; reflexive loop
**Memory Support:**Limited to model context window
**Tool Use:**Any Python library via dynamic code
**Notable Features:**Extreme simplicity (\~1000 LOC), code generation, Hub integration
**Why it Stands Out:**SmolAgents takes a radically different approach to agent design. Instead of complex orchestration, it creates minimal agents that &quot;think in Python code&quot; –literally generating and executing Python snippets to solve problems.
This minimal design (just \~1000 lines of code) offers unparalleled flexibility. The agent can use any Python library by simply importing it in generated code, and security is handled through optional sandboxing via Docker or E2B.
SmolAgents is perfect for rapid prototyping, experimental research, and scenarios where you want the LLM to have maximum freedom in solving problems. Its integration with the Hugging Face Hub allows sharing and reusing agents and tools.
**GitHub:**[huggingface/smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)
### 8.[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)-[APIpie Integration Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/Llama-Index)[​](#8-llamaindex---apipie-integration-guide)
**Language:**Python
**Agent Style:**Data-centric, retrieval-augmented
**Execution Logic:**Query engines, orchestration around data
**Memory Support:**Vector stores, indices, knowledge graphs
**Tool Use:**Data connectors, query engines as tools
**Notable Features:**Best-in-class RAG, multi-modal indexing
**Why it Stands Out:**LlamaIndex specializes in connecting language models to data. While other frameworks focus on actions and reasoning, LlamaIndex excels at retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and knowledge access.
Its agent architecture centers on Query Engines that intelligently route questions to appropriate data sources (indices). LlamaIndex provides rich tools for document ingestion, chunking, and indexing, making it the go-to choice for building agents that answer questions from custom data.
With built-in support for various index types (vector, keyword, knowledge graph) and connectors to dozens of data sources, LlamaIndex simplifies what would otherwise be complex data engineering.
**GitHub:**[run-llama/llama\_index](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)
### 9.[Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai)-[APIpie Integration Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/PydanticAI)[​](#9-pydantic-ai---apipie-integration-guide)
**Language:**Python
**Agent Style:**Schema-driven, type-safe
**Execution Logic:**Structured I/O with validation
**Memory Support:**Custom integration options
**Tool Use:**Schema-validated function calling
**Notable Features:**Type safety, multi-model support, Logfire integration
**Why it Stands Out:**Pydantic AI brings the rigor of type checking to the unpredictable world of LLMs. Created by the team behind Pydantic (used in FastAPI), it enforces output schemas that eliminate many parsing errors and ensure consistent output formats.
This type-safe approach is particularly valuable for production applications where reliability is paramount. By defining strict schemas for agent outputs, Pydantic AI reduces the need for error handling and retry logic.
The framework supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) and integrates with Pydantic Logfire for monitoring, making it a compelling choice for enterprise applications that can&#x27;t afford unexpected behavior.
**GitHub:**[pydantic/pydantic-ai](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai)
### 10.[Agno (formerly Phidata)](https://github.com/agno-ai/agno)-[APIpie Integration Guide](https://apipie.ai/docs/Integrations/Agent-Frameworks/Agno)[​](#10-agno-formerly-phidata---apipie-integration-guide)
**Language:**Python
**Agent Style:**Lightweight, multimodal
**Execution Logic:**Efficient chain-of-thought
**Memory Support:**Long-term storage, vector stores
**Tool Use:**Python functions, API integrations
**Notable Features:**Extreme performance, multimodal support, API generation
**Why it Stands Out:**Agno prioritizes performance and efficiency. While other frameworks might take seconds to instantiate an agent, Agno can do it in microseconds, using 50× less memory than alternatives like LangGraph. This efficiency enables scenarios like running thousands of lightweight agents concurrently.
Beyond performance, Agno stands out for its native multimodal capabilities. It seamlessly handles text, images, and audio in agent tasks without requiring complex integrations. The framework also automatically generates FastAPI routes for agents, simplifying deployment.
For developers who found other frameworks too heavy, Agno offers a compelling alternative that maintains flexibility while dramatically reducing overhead.
