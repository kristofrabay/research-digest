## Summary

This page describes a tutorial video on building a **multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **LangChain** and the **Unstructured library**. This system is designed to query complex documents like **PDFs containing text, images, and tables** by leveraging the multimodal capabilities of advanced **LLMs (like GPT-4 with vision)**.

The tutorial covers:
*   Setting up the **Unstructured library** for parsing and pre-processing diverse document types (including images).
*   Creating a document retrieval system that integrates both **textual and visual data**.
*   Integrating this multimodal data into a **LangChain-powered RAG pipeline**.
*   Achieving **comprehensive understanding and accurate responses** using a multimodal LLM.

This directly relates to your query regarding **multimodal RAG**, **document understanding**, **PDF parsing**, and the use of models like **GPT-4V**.

## Full Content

This tutorial video guides you through building a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain and the Unstructured library. You'll learn how to create an AI-powered system that can query complex documents, such as PDFs containing text, images, tables, and plots, by harnessing the multimodal capabilities of advanced Language Learning Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 with vision.\n\nWe begin by setting up the Unstructured library to parse and pre-process various document formats, from images to text. Then, we use LangChain to establish a document retrieval system that integrates textual and visual data into a multimodal LLM, enabling comprehensive understanding and accurate, relevant responses. This method is perfect for tasks requiring insights across multiple data formats, such as technical documents, scientific papers, and presentations.\n\nWhether you're a beginner in multimodal pipelines or looking to improve your RAG workflows, this step-by-step guide will help you create an intelligent document querying system that goes beyond text, broadening the scope for real-world applications. Don't miss this opportunity to make document intelligence genuinely multimodal!\n\nTopics\n===\n1. How can you set up the Unstructured library to parse and pre-process diverse document types?\n2. Want to learn how to create a document retrieval system that utilizes both textual and visual data?\n3. Discover how to integrate multimodal data into a LangChain-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline!\n4. Uncover the benefits of using a multimodal LLM for more comprehensive understanding and accurate responses.\n5.
