## Summary

The webpage, titled "Beyond Vanilla RAG: The 7 Modern RAG Architectures Every AI Engineer Must Know," is likely to discuss various Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures.

Based on your query, the page is **highly relevant** as it is expected to cover:

*   **RAG architectures** (specifically modern ones beyond "vanilla").
*   It is very likely to touch upon **vector databases**, **embeddings** (especially with new efficient models), **rerankers**, **hybrid search**, and **chunking strategies**, as these are core components of modern RAG systems.

However, the provided text snippet is only the title and navigation elements, not the main content. Therefore, while the topic strongly suggests the content you are looking for, I cannot confirm the exact details without the body of the article.

**Summary based on the title and query:** The page discusses **7 Modern RAG Architectures** and is expected to cover key components like **vector databases, embeddings, rerankers, hybrid search, and chunking strategies** relevant to advanced RAG implementation.
