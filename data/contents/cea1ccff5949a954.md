## Summary

The provided webpage discusses the use of **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for **LLM-based automatic heuristic design (AHD)**. This method aims to generate high-quality heuristics for complex optimization tasks (like route planning) by organizing LLM-generated heuristics in a tree structure to explore the solution space more comprehensively than existing population-based evolutionary computation methods.

While the user query covers a broad range of topics related to **Reasoning LLMs, chain-of-thought, planning with LLMs, MCTS for language models, and hallucination reduction**, the webpage specifically focuses on:

*   **Planning with LLMs** (in the context of generating heuristics for optimization tasks).
*   **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for language models** (specifically applied to LLM-based heuristic evolution).

It does not explicitly detail reasoning, chain-of-thought, inference-time compute, self-reflection, test-time scaling, grounding, or factuality reduction techniques.

> Abstract:Handcrafting heuristics for solving complex optimization tasks (e.g., route planning and task allocation) is a common practice but requires extensive domain knowledge. Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-based automatic heuristic design (AHD) methods have shown promise in generating high-quality heuristics without manual interventions. Existing LLM-based AHD methods employ a population to maintain a fixed number of top-performing LLM-generated heuristics and introduce evolutionary computation (EC) to iteratively enhance the population. However, these population-based procedures cannot fully develop the potential of each heuristic and are prone to converge into local optima. To more comprehensively explore the space of heuristics, this paper proposes to use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for LLM-based heuristic evolution. The proposed MCTS-AHD method organizes all LLM-generated heuristics in a tree structure and can better develop the potential of temporarily underperforming heuristics. In experiments, MCTS-AHD delivers significantly higher-quality heuristics on various complex tasks. Our code is available.
