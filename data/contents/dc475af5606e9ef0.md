## Summary

The provided webpage describes **MCP Tools**, a command-line interface for interacting with **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** using both stdio and HTTP transport.

It details the following:
*   **What it is:** A CLI for interacting with MCP servers.
*   **How to use it:** Install via Homebrew or from source and execute commands in the terminal.
*   **Key Features:** Supports stdio and HTTP transport, allows discovery and calling of tools, listing resources, and offers output formats like table, JSON, and pretty JSON.
*   **Use Cases:** Interacting with tools on an MCP server, automating tasks with MCP-compatible services, and exploring resources/prompts.

**The user query asks about:** `agent_infrastructure: MCP servers, tool use, agent memory, agentic memory, agent frameworks, LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents SDK, Anthropic Agents SDK, Google SDK, function calling, structured outputs, agent orchestration`.

**Summary relative to the query:**

The page directly addresses **MCP servers** and **tool use** in the context of the MCP protocol via the MCP Tools CLI. However, it **does not mention** agent memory, agentic memory, agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex), specific SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), function calling, structured outputs, or agent orchestration.

**Conclusion:** The page provides information on MCP servers and tool interaction but does not cover the broader agent infrastructure topics listed in the query.

**No answer found** for the majority of the specific agent infrastructure components requested.
