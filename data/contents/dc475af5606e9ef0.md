## Summary

The webpage describes **MCP Tools**, a command-line interface for interacting with **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** using both stdio and HTTP transport.

Key features include:
*   Supporting both stdio (default) and HTTP transport.
*   Allowing users to discover and call tools, list resources, and interact with MCP-compatible services.
*   Providing output formats like table, JSON, and pretty JSON.

The user query lists many advanced agent-related concepts (e.g., agent frameworks like LangChain, memory techniques, context engineering, various SDKs, function calling, agent orchestration, and training methods like SFT/RL). **The webpage does not mention or discuss these specific agent infrastructure components.**

**Summary relative to the query:** The page focuses solely on a CLI tool for interacting with MCP servers. It does not cover the extensive list of agent infrastructure topics mentioned in your query.
