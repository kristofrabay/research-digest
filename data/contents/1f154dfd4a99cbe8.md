The company has achieved SOC 2 Type II compliance with no exceptions noted—the gold standard for data security in financial services. Our single-tenant architecture ensures each client&#x27;s data remains completely isolated from others, and we maintain robust encryption protocols both in-transit (TLS 1.2+) and at-rest (AES-256).
The company implements strict role-based access controls, continuous vulnerability scanning, and regular third-party penetration testing.
Importantly, ToltIQ adheres to Zero Data Retention policies and never uses client data to train its AI models. All data resides exclusively in the USA under a comprehensive Information Security Program.
We also provide multiple layers of user based privacy protection including:
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
* Role-Based Access Control: Our platform supports Regular Users and Admins.
* Document Access: Regular Users can manage documents in standard deals. Only Admins can manage documents in Vault Deals.
* Privacy Settings: Option to choose Firm-Wide (visible to all users) or Private (restricted access).
