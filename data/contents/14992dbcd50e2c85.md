## Summary

The webpage describes how the new `langchain-mcp-adapters` package allows developers to integrate existing **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers into **LangChain** agents.

**Key points relevant to your query:**

*   **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** A protocol developed by Anthropic for structured interactions between language models and tool servers.
*   **LangChain Integration:** The adapter converts MCP tools into LangChain/LangGraph-compatible tools, allowing hundreds of existing MCP tools to be used seamlessly inside LangChain agents.
*   **Agent Frameworks:** The article focuses on using this integration within **LangChain** and **LangGraph** workflows.
*   **Tool Use:** It demonstrates reusing an existing Box MCP server (which wraps Box AI endpoints) to provide structured data extraction tools (like `box_ai_ask`) to a LangChain agent.
*   **Benefits:** This avoids writing glue code, allows reusing existing MCP tools, and enables chaining multiple tool servers together in a single agent.

The page does not explicitly discuss **MCP servers** as a general infrastructure component outside of the context of LangChain integration, nor does it detail **agent memory**, **agentic memory**, **OpenAI Agents SDK**, **Anthropic Agents SDK**, **Google SDK**, **function calling**, **structured outputs**, or **agent orchestration** beyond the context of building LangGraph workflows that utilize MCP tools.

LangChain agents just got a whole lot more powerful —and interoperable.
With the rise of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), developers are rapidly publishing tool servers that expose powerful capabilities through a standardized protocol. Meanwhile, the LangChain ecosystem has become a go-to framework for building agents and orchestrated workflows with language models.
The new`langchain-mcp-adapters`package brings these two worlds together. In this article, I’ll show how easy it is to reuse an existing MCP server—in this case, a Box MCP server—and turn it into a LangChain-compatible agent using the LangChain MCP adapter. No need to write glue code or reinvent the wheel.
Here is a video about this content:
## What Is MCP and why use MCP adapters?
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**is a protocol developed by Anthropic to enable structured interactions between language models and tool servers.
The LangChain MCP adapter lets you:
* Convert MCP tools into LangChain/LangGraph-compatible ones.
* Interact with tools across multiple MCP servers.
* Seamlessly use hundreds of existing MCP tools inside LangChain agents.
This means you can now bring any MCP-compatible server —including custom tools you or others have already built —into the LangChain ecosystem in just a few lines of code.
## What the Box MCP server does?
In this demo, our Box MCP server provides structured data extraction capabilities. It wraps Box AI endpoints and exposes tools like`box\_ai\_ask`, making it easy for agents to parse unstructured documents stored in Box.
## Code Walkthrough
Here’s the gist of how we wire it up:
```
`from langchain\_mcp\_adapters.tools import load\_mcp\_tools
from langgraph.prebuilt import create\_react\_agent
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio\_client
# Start the MCP server locally using uvicorn
server\_params = StdioServerParameters(
command="uv",
args=[
"--directory",
"/Users/rbarbosa/Documents/code/python/box/mcp-server-box",
"run",
"src/mcp\_server\_box.py",
],
)
# Connect and load tools
async with stdio\_client(server\_params) as (read, write):
async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
await session.initialize()
tools = await load\_mcp\_tools(session)
agent = create\_react\_agent(ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"), tools)`
```
That’s it —your Box tools are now LangChain-compatible.
### What about LangGraph?
We got you covered:
```
`from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from langchain\_mcp\_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langchain\_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create\_react\_agent
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
@asynccontextmanager
async def make\_graph():
async with MultiServerMCPClient(
{
"box\_mcp": {
# "command": "python",
# # Make sure to update to the full absolute path to your math\_server.py file
# "args": ["/path/to/math\_server.py"],
"command": "uv",
"args": [
"--directory",
"/code/python/box/mcp-server-box",
"run",
"src/mcp\_server\_box.py",
],
"transport": "stdio",
},
}
) as client:
agent = create\_react\_agent(model, client.get\_tools())
yield agent`
```
Run it using:
```
`uv run langgraph dev --config src/langgraph.json`
```

## Why this matters
This setup makes it trivial to:
* Reuse any existing MCP tool server inside LangChain or LangGraph agents
* Avoid duplicating code or writing custom tool wrappers
* Chain multiple tool servers together (e.g., Box + Math + CRM tools) in a single agent
* Combine tools from different servers into a single agent
* **Build LangGraph workflows that use MCP tools**
If you already have useful tools exposed via MCP, this adapter makes them instantly accessible to LangChain workflows.
## Try it yourself
Check out the[LangChain Box MCP adapter GitHub repo](https://github.com/box-community/langchain-box-mcp-adapter)and give it a spin with your own tool servers —or reuse the Box one I used here.
