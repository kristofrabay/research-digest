It’s safe to say that investors are taking full advantage of generative AI agents for private equity. According to[](https://www.bain.com/globalassets/noindex/2024/bain_report_global-private-equity-report-2024.pdf)Bain &amp; Company’s[2024 Global Private Equity Report](https://www.bain.com/globalassets/noindex/2024/bain_report_global-private-equity-report-2024.pdf), companies use this technology to automate back-end functions, conduct due diligence, and evaluate portfolios. However, the “era” of exploratory AI initiatives without clear performance metrics is waning.
Limited partners (LPs) have adopted a cautious stance on AI technologies. According to the 2025 LP Perspectives Study by Private Equity International,[55% of respondents](https://www.privateequityinternational.com/lps-take-a-cautious-approach-to-ai/)who are holding back on using AI models have yet to find a compelling use case, while 36% say they need a better understanding of the workflows, and 32% want more profound insights into the AI outputs.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ad66655ff929df8ba7223_1.%20Private%20Equity%20Perspectives%20Towards%20AI_1.webp)
Successful integration of AI agents requires an understanding of the technology, the correct implementation strategies, a focus on measurable success metrics, and the ability to scale. This article looks at how you can address these concerns and leverage AI effectively.
## What is an AI Agent?
An AI agent is a goal-oriented system capable of performing complex tasks autonomously. It can interpret goals, plan steps, execute and orchestrate them across other artificial intelligence systems, monitor progress, and learn based on results.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ad7a9494eed051867fd66_2.%20What%20is%20an%20AI%20agent%20(2).webp)
Generative AI elevates the capabilities of these agents beyond traditional automation. It allows them to understand tasks written in human language, extract meaning from numerous sources, generate new information, and answer questions clearly.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ad80d4a4b34c0c627e533_3.%20AI%20Agents%20in%20PE.webp)
In private equity, AI agents with generative capabilities can operate with context and make informed investment decisions when the exact course of action isn’t defined explicitly. For example, they can complete due diligence checks, prepare financial models, generate financial reports, and inform portfolio companies about critical events.
### AI Agents for Private Equity vs. Traditional AI Automation Tools
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ad8a63dfc33e8f74411dc_4.%20AI%20Agents%20for%20Private%20Equity.webp)
Agents have distinct advantages over regular AI solutions and robotic automation that make them well-suited for the private equity industry.
* Agents read and extract context from multiple alternative data sources (data rooms, legal contracts, market signals, emails, and transcripts) that traditional systems ignore or oversimplify.
* The extraction and generation are all part of the same execution chain and don’t require human judgment.
* Agents refine their accuracy and decision-making logic based on post-deal outcomes and portfolio performance. For example, if past investments with certain indicators underperformed, the agent can prioritize those risk factors in the future.
When properly configured, implemented, and trained on relevant data, Gen AI applications become a functioning part of the investment team. What’s more, generative AI prototypes can be built and refined in weeks by an experienced team.
## Agent-Based Generative AI: Private Equity Use Cases
Generative AI agents can operate like autonomous team members, using automated scripts and productivity-enhancing tools. They can be a significant cost- and time-saver when dealing with volumes of qualitative and quantitative data.
Below are some examples of how generative AI agents are being deployed within private equity companies.
### Customer Support
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684add414a4b34c0c62b6e10_5.%20Customer%20support%20agent.webp)
Portfolio companies, especially in B2C and B2B sectors, often maintain large support teams to handle customer queries ranging from account issues to onboarding assistance. Generative AI-powered customer agents can offload routine tasks from human departments and speed up ticket resolution times.
AI agents are trained on product documentation, past support interactions, CRM history, and user behavior patterns. This helps the agents understand nuanced inquiries, respond in natural language, and escalate to human agents only when necessary. Plus, of course, these routine interactions can be handled autonomously at any time.
### Lead Scoring
Analysts need to scan hundreds of startup profiles, news alerts, and market signals every day to inform their decisions. While the process is repetitive, the decisions require subjective judgment. However, even the most diligent analyst can occasionally miss revenue enhancement opportunities because something didn’t catch their attention.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684addacae2e501899b24aaf_6.%20Lead%20scoring%20agent_1.webp)
Agentic AI in private equity utilizes generative AI capabilities to understand the context behind each deal and evaluate it based on financial thresholds, investment policies, and previous transactions. AI agents can go beyond surface-level analysis by collecting data about the lead from patent filings, social media signals, testimonials, and social proof.
These systems can explain why a target is promising, highlight areas requiring further diligence, and continuously re-rank scores in real time using dynamic signals (like new hires, funding rounds, or regulatory filings).
In this way, the AI agent can complement the analyst’s role, providing extra context and flagging opportunities or risks using automated alerts.
### FP&amp;A Copilots
Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&amp;A) teams spend a lot of time cleaning data and reconciling numbers. AI agents can perform many of these tasks faster and with less human oversight.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ae047ae2e501899b43e49_7.%20FP%26A%20Copilot%20diagram.webp)
FP&amp;A copilots integrate with financial systems (like NetSuite, SAP, QuickBooks), enterprise management platforms (ERP), and customer management systems. This allows them to generate real-time rolling forecasts, conduct multi-scenario simulations (like revenue underperformance and FX volatility), and detect anomalies (such as margin compressions). This information can be presented as annotated reports with visual charts and commentary.
### KPI Reporting
Performance indicators can be reported differently in various portfolio companies. However, traditional reporting tools may have issues with inconsistent labeling and data formats.
An AI agent can understand the contexts behind the numbers in zcolumn names, as well as adjust for differences in terminology. Meanwhile, generative capabilities can then standardize key performance indicators, infer missing data, and present strategic insights in formats customized for each partner.
### RFP Copilot
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ae0c73dfc33e8f7486ace_8.%20RFP%20Copilot_1.webp)
Agent-based copilots can process a huge number of Request for Proposal (RFP) documents based on your company’s requirements, policies, technical specifications, pricing logic, and historical submissions. Additionally, it can automatically assemble responses or escalate to the sales and deal teams. Generative AI also helps draft proposals that align with the vendor’s requirements, brand voice, and customer context.
### Document Processing and Review
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ae28f4a4b34c0c6303ea1_9.%20Document%20processing%20and%20review%20document_1.webp)
Agentic AI in private equity helps with cognitively demanding and time-consuming tasks, like reviewing and synthesizing information from Confidential Information Memorandums (CIMs), financial audits, HR materials, and disclosures.
Even if the process is not entirely automated, generative AI can become a helpful tool for analysis. For example, it can help find information in embedded spreadsheets, scanned documents, and unstructured PDFs, as well as search for inconsistencies between documents.
These applications can provide measurable gains, but only when target companies know when and how to implement them.
## How PE Firms are Deploying AI Agents Across Holdings
Developing a deployment strategy helps firms identify the right place for AI agents and expand pilots across the portfolio.
### Portfolio-Wide Opportunity Scans
Firms conduct systematic scans of their portfolio to identify which companies are most exposed to disruptions. For instance, the recent Bloomberg Intelligence survey (via[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/01/13/how-ai-revolution-is-driving-200000-layoffs-on-wall-street/)) shows that 54% of banking jobs may become automated (with a 3% net reduction in employees), and 25% of Wall Street tech chiefs expect a 5-10% workforce reduction.
Agentic AI can help evaluate companies based on custom factors to determine the likelihood of disruptions and opportunities for automation, taking into account potential EBITDA leverage and customer expectations in the domain. For example,[CVC Capital Partners applied generative AI](https://aiexpert.network/cvc-ai/)to scan over 120 portfolio companies. This helped the company optimize operations and prioritize investments based on resilience and readiness for AI.
### Streamlining Operations Across Portfolios
Generative AI agents can enhance operations as early as the sourcing stage, all the way through to exit. This allows firms to create a knowledge loop where valuable insights from each phase improve the next.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ae342d7df7aa090d39ca5_10.%20Streamlining%20Operations%20Across%20Portfolios_2.webp)
* **Deal sourcing**. Automatically rank deals, generate summary sheets, and push alerts to sector leads when excellent-fit companies emerge.
* **Pipeline monitoring**. Monitor CRM entries, pitch decks, and investor notes to detect inconsistencies, duplicate opportunities, and adjust priorities.
* **Due diligence**. Identify discrepancies, flag missing clauses, and generate Q&amp;A templates for advisers.
* **Meeting optimization**. Transcribe conference notes and automatically categorize data for virtual data room meetings.
* **Exit strategy planning**. Archive deal insights, document what worked, and preserve diligence lessons from successful exits.
The AI agent-driven approach adds consistency across the deal lifecycle while removing unnecessary human validation.
### Cross-Portfolio Replication and Knowledge Transfer
Deploying AI agents individually on each portfolio firm can create data silos or prevent the AI agent from learning from other companies. That’s why leading organizations complement their strategy with centralized agents.
Companies apply different generative AI tools to their portfolios, but store them in a unified agent registry with version control and audit logs. These central registries operate under pre-vetted data-sharing policies, have modular prompt chains, and include guidelines for agentic AI implementation in different environments.
## Building a Central AI Playbook: Components
A centralized AI agent system requires you to optimize these essential components: infrastructure, reusability, governance, controls, and talent.
### Infrastructure
AI agents rely on infrastructures that span continuous layers, orchestration tools, and feedback loops. This complexity multiplies when each firm has its own tech stack and data formats.
The most scalable option is to adopt a modular three-tiered agent architecture:
* **Input handling layer**. Extracts structured and unstructured data in real time, standardizing it for generative AI agents.
* **Cognitive layer**. Interprets business context, recalls prior outputs, and adapts reasoning.
* **Action layer**. Sends outputs to the operating systems.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ae3ddae2e501899b788f4_11.%20Building%20a%20Central%20AI%20Playbook_%20Infrastructure_4.webp)
Low-code[AI agent builders](https://www.getdynamiq.ai/product/agents)like Dynamiq allow central teams to deploy workflows without writing orchestration code, while running within firm-controlled environments.
### Reusability
You should design AI agents as modular assets that can be adapted across sectors and companies. To make them reusable, ensure they include:
* Pre-structured models (templates) for common use cases like FP&amp;A reporting agents, RFP copilots, churn risk monitors, and more
* A repository of tested prompt chains that correspond to different functions
* Defined approaches to validate new applications
Dynamiq&#x27;s platform supports these accelerators through[low-code workflow builders](https://www.getdynamiq.ai/product/workflows)that let Ops Leads prototype AI agents without requiring engineers.
### Governance
Agentic AI adoption in the PE industry requires multiple layers of governance:
* **Strategic**(allowed use cases, business alignment rules, access limitations)
* **Operational**(stakeholders that own each agent and conduct output reviews)
* **Technical**(logging, version control, model explainability, test coverage)### Controls
Because generative AI can influence decisions, its implementation requires new policies beyond basic IT controls:
* **Role-based access**. AI Agents should never have access to information outside of their intended domain.
* **Memory auditability**. Each prompt, input, decision, and output must be recorded in an immutable format with timestamps.
* **Contradiction detection**. Direct contradictions with existing policies, financial goals, or controls should trigger alerts for compliance officers and data scientists.### Talent
Some firms rely too heavily on external vendors, which introduces information security concerns and reduces institutional learning. Instead, invest in your own center of excellence that includes:
* **Internal fluency programs**. Training for deal teams, finance leads, and operators on using generative AI and agentic workflows.
* **Review boards**. Check-ins where new AI agents or modifications are reviewed for design, potential risks, and cross-firm benefits.
* **Change management toolkits**. Communication templates and onboarding plans for frontline teams.
Finally, you should focus on the right metrics to measure the effects of your AI initiatives.
## ROI Measurement Frameworks for Private Equity Generative AI
Generic metrics (like time saved on tasks or response time improvements) are still important, but ideally, you should tie them to concrete operations or cost structures. For example, the impact of agent-based generative AI in private equity can be measured with key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
* **Analyst time saved**. Time saved is meaningful if it reduces the headcount required or frees up analysts to work on high-value projects.
* **Usage rates**. It’s critical to measure how often your teams use generative AI in their daily tasks.
* **Speed-to-insight**. AI agents that monitor metrics in real time and auto-alert teams shorten the time it takes to spot a risk or opportunity.
* **Forecast accuracy**. Accurate FP&amp;A agents can reduce the gap between projected and actual financial performance.
* **Sales win rate**. RFP copilots can improve the percentage of closed proposals, which is reflected in annual recurring revenue.
* **EBITDA**. When generative AI reduces operations costs and boosts decision-making, savings flow directly into Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA).
These metrics can help you determine**the AI multiplier**—the uplift in valuation multiples and exit attractiveness powered by agent-based generative technologies. However, this metric makes sense only if the technology impacts value creation workflows and can be reused at scale.
## Getting Started with a Portfolio Company Pilot
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6633c32f4debce929b72200b/684ae4278423dbd82a3d1469_12.%20Steps%20to%20Get%20Started%20with%20a%20Portfolio%20Company%20Pilot_1.webp)
Private equity companies usually deploy AI workflows across the organization, but start with the operations that create the most impact with minimal risks. The following framework can help you implement workflows in areas that deliver immediate benefits before embedding them across portfolios and operations.
1. **Identify a business problem or inefficiency**that generative AI agents can remediate.
2. **Focus on a clear objective**, avoiding the temptation to spread attention across too many problems at once.
3. **Define success metrics**to identify a measurable ROI from the pilot.
4. **Vet a portfolio company**based on its technical readiness and stakeholders’ willingness to modernize.
5. **Develop and test in iterations**, ideally using low-code platforms to build minimum viable products (MVPs) with defined boundaries.
6. **Assign ownership roles**, such as the stakeholders responsible for data access, performance tracking, and user feedback.
Document every stage of the implementation. During deployment, development sprints should address accuracy, friction, false positives or negatives, and hard-coded limits.
Once the AI agent consistently hits KPIs, you can start expanding the scope by adding more users, creating more prompt chains and workflows, and integrating with more market data sources.
## Conclusion
Generative AI agents in private equity should be applied iteratively to critical processes in suitable companies. And when rolling out new technologies, their investment professionals should prioritize the quantitative metrics that are directly tied to business value and operational efficiency.
More importantly, these companies should start with a pilot that can validate the investment early. Then, with appropriate centralized governance, the use cases can be adopted across operations, business functions, and portfolio companies.
