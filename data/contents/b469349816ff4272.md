## Summary

Keye is an AI-powered due diligence platform built by private equity investors for private equity investors. It transforms raw deal files into structured, investor-ready outputs by automating data cuts, running real math, and surfacing insights quickly.

The platform focuses on:
*   **Alpha Generation:** Helping users quickly identify bad deals to pass on and focus on winners.
*   **Scaling Diligence:** Automating grunt work like data cleaning, anomaly detection, formatting, and modeling to handle more deal flow.
*   **Accuracy and Transparency:** Ensuring 100% accurate analysis with audit-grade transparency, linking every output back to its raw source.

While the page heavily details its capabilities in **due diligence automation** for **private equity**, it does not explicitly mention multi-agent systems, venture capital, deal sourcing, portfolio monitoring, financial report generation, or integrations with specific databases like PitchBook, AlphaSense, Preqin, CapIQ, or Bloomberg.

&quot;We&#x27;ve tried several AI tools, but most feel too generic for private equity needs. Keye stood out because it&#x27;s clearly designed with our workflow in mind. Instead of just summarizing data, it breaks down critical metrics—like customer retention and growth drivers—so we&#x27;re able to assess true business health quickly.&quot;
