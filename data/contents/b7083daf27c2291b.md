## Summary

ToltIQ is an AI-powered platform designed to streamline due diligence for Private Markets Investment Professionals, focusing on efficiency gains (35-85% productivity increase) and time savings (60-70% on review/analysis).

The platform offers:
*   **VDR-Native Processing:** Contextual understanding of deal data linked directly to sources.
*   **Workflow Alignment:** Customizable prompt library for financial, legal, and operational due diligence.
*   **Technical Capabilities:** Bulk Query, Data Chat for Excel analysis, Document Summaries, and Quick Chat for general LLM access.
*   **Flexible Design:** Model-Agnostic, supporting OpenAI ChatGPT and Anthropic models, with single-tenant architecture.
*   **Use Cases:** CIM analysis, contract extraction, VDR reviews, portfolio monitoring, competitive analysis, and data cleanup.
*   **Security:** SOC 2 Type II compliant, single-tenant architecture, robust encryption, and Zero Data Retention policies.

While the platform supports various analysis tasks, including financial data extraction and risk identification, the user query specifically asks about **multi-agent systems for finance, private equity, venture capital, due diligence automation, investment opportunity analysis, deal sourcing, portfolio monitoring, agents for data analysis, financial report generation, and integrations with PitchBook, AlphaSense, Preqin, CapIQ, and Bloomberg.**

ToltIQ focuses heavily on **due diligence automation, data analysis, and portfolio monitoring** within the private equity context. It mentions integration with VDRs and CRM systems via secure APIs, but **it does not explicitly mention agents for deal sourcing, investment opportunity analysis, or integrations with specific external data providers like PitchBook, AlphaSense, Preqin, CapIQ, or Bloomberg.**

Therefore, while it covers several related areas, it does not fully address all components of the user's query regarding specific multi-agent structures or named external data integrations.
