## Summary

The webpage introduces **UniDoc-Bench**, a large-scale, realistic benchmark specifically designed for **Document-Centric Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)**.

**Key aspects related to your query:**

*   **Multimodal RAG and Document Understanding:** The benchmark addresses the limitations of current evaluations by focusing on real-world PDF documents (70k pages across 8 domains) that contain interleaved text, tables, and figures. It aims to evaluate systems that need to retrieve and reason over information across these modalities.
*   **PDF Parsing and Chart/Table Extraction:** The data curation process involves parsing PDFs to extract text chunks, tables, and figures. Tables and figures are stored separately, and placeholders are inserted into the text to represent their location, facilitating multimodal grounding.
*   **Report Generation with LLMs (MM-RAG):** The core purpose is to evaluate MM-RAG pipelines. The benchmark includes 1,600 human-verified Question-Answer (QA) pairs covering factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning, requiring evidence from text, tables, and images.
*   **Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Models:** The experiments compare various RAG paradigms, including text-only, image-only, multimodal joint retrieval (using models like GME), and multimodal text-image fusion. The results indicate that **text-image fusion RAG** (combining separate text and image retrievals) performs best, outperforming joint multimodal embedding approaches.
*   **GPT-4V, Claude vision, Gemini:** While the text mentions using **GPT-4** and **Gemini-Pro** in the data synthesis pipeline (for QA generation and verification), it does not specifically benchmark or detail the performance of dedicated vision models like GPT-4V, Claude vision, or Gemini as the final RAG generator/reasoner, though they are implicitly involved in the broader VLM landscape discussed in related works.
*   **Structured Document Output:** The evaluation metrics focus on answer **completeness** and **faithfulness**, which are crucial for ensuring the generated reports/answers are accurate and grounded in the retrieved multimodal evidence.

**In summary, UniDoc-Bench provides a unified platform to benchmark MM-RAG systems that handle complex document understanding tasks involving text, tables, and charts, finding that fusing separate text and image retrieval is currently superior to joint

The user query asks for a summary related to **multimodal and generation** topics, specifically mentioning: Vision-language models, multimodal RAG, document understanding, PDF parsing, chart/table extraction, report generation with LLMs, GPT-4V, Claude vision, Gemini, and structured document output.

The provided webpage text is an appendix section from a paper, likely titled "UniDoc-Bench: A Unified Benchmark for Document-Centric Multimodal RAG," which details dataset creation, QA synthesizing prompts, human annotation guidelines, and experimental results comparing different RAG systems (Text-only, Image-only, Multimodal (MM), and Text+Image fusion (T++I)).

Here is a summary of how the text relates to the query:

*   **Multimodal RAG & Vision-Language Models:** The entire document focuses on **Multimodal RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over documents. It references several RAG systems (MM, T++I) and compares retrieval performance based on different modalities required for the answer (Text-only, Img-only, Text+Img). It also compares multimodal embeddings (Voyage vs. GME).
*   **Document Understanding, PDF Parsing, Chart/Table Extraction:** Appendix B.3 explicitly mentions parsing PDFs into "text chunks, images of figures, and images of tables" using `unstructured`. Appendix B.4 provides detailed question templates for **Factual Retrieval, Comparison, Summarization, and Causal/Reasoning** questions specifically tailored for a finance domain, implying structured data extraction is a key component. Appendix F.1 discusses classifying images as "content-rich" (providing information not present in the text) or "illustrative," which relates directly to extracting information from visual elements like charts/tables.
*   **Report Generation with LLMs:** Appendix A mentions using **LLMs** for "polishing grammar and improving readability" and "assisting in the evaluation of RAG outputs" and "synthesizing the QA pairs." While it doesn't detail *report generation* itself, it confirms the use of LLMs in the RAG pipeline for generation/assistance tasks.
*   **GPT-4V, Claude vision, Gemini:** The text mentions using **Gemini-2.5-pro** in Appendix F.1 to classify images. It does not explicitly mention GPT-4V or Claude vision, though the context implies

###### Abstract
Multimodal retrieval-augmented Generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented—focusing on either text or images in isolation, or simplified multimodal setup, failing to capture document-centric multimodal use cases.
In this paper, we introduceUniDoc-Bench111The code and data will be available at: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/UniDOC-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from7070k real-world PDF pages across88domains.
Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and
figures, then generates1,6001,600multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries.
To ensure reliability,20%20\\%of QA pairs
are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication.UniDoc-Benchsupports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms —1) text-only, 2) image-only, 3)*multimodal*text–image fusion and 4)*multimodal*joint retrieval —under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics.
Our experiments show that multimodal text–image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding–based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.
## 1Introduction
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely used approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases> (Gao et al., [> 2023
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib6)> ; Fan et al., [> 2024
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib3)> )
. The dominant text-only pipeline applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR)> (Li et al., [> 2022
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib10)> ; Xue et al., [> 2024
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib30)> ; Poznanski et al., [> 2025
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib21)> )
to flatten document pages into text, indexes them as chunks, retrieves top-k text passages, and feeds them to a generator.
However, many answers depend on information embedded in figures, charts, tables, and complex layouts, where OCR often discards crucial spatial and visual semantics (e.g., map, axes, bar lengths, color encodings)> (Ma et al., [> 2024a
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib13)> ; Faysse et al., [> 2024a
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib4)> )
.
These limitations have driven the rapid development of multimodal RAG (MM-RAG), which embeds documents across modalities (text, tables, and images) and retrieves and reasons over them jointly, emerging as a key paradigm for document intelligence.
Current MM-RAG evaluation benchmarks exhibit substantial limitations, as summarized in Table[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S1.T1).
Many are restricted to a single image or a single document page as reference> (Mathew et al., [> 2021
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib16)> ; [> 2022
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib17)> ; Zhu et al., [> 2022

, cover narrow domains> Mathew et al. (

[> 2024

, under-represent modalities> (Li et al., [> 2024
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib11)> ; Mathew et al., [> 2022
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib17)> )
, operate at limited scale (few queries/pages)> (Ma et al., [> 2024b

](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib26)> )
or lack a highly relevant database for RAG evaluation> (Ma et al., [> 2024b
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib14)> )
.
These gaps hinder fair and comprehensive comparison across methods.
Moreover, debatable claims have emerged —such as that “image retrieval is all you need”> (Faysse et al., [> 2024a
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib4)> ; Su et al., [> 2025
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib24)> )
or that multimodal retrieval is inherently superior> (Zhang et al., [> 2024b
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib35)> ; Yu et al., [> 2024b
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib33)> )
—without enough fair and unified evaluation.
In response, we introduceUniDoc-Bench, a manually verified benchmark spanning88domains and covering text, chart, and table content, explicitly designed for cross-modality grounding with examples shown in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S1.F1).
Crucially,UniDoc-Benchenables apples-to-apples evaluation of text-retrieval, image-retrieval, multimodal text-image-fusion retrieval, and multimodal joint retrieval pipelines using highly relevant large document database and multi-type, cross-modality-grounding queries under a unified protocol.
This setup provides an unbiased view of when multimodal retrieval offers advantages beyond single modalities.
In practice,UniDoc-Benchquantifies multimodal gains, guides system design choices, and accelerates the development of effective MM-RAG systems for real-world document intelligence.
![Refer to caption](x1.png)Figure 1:UniDoc-Benchoverview.
We curate a high-quality multimodal RAG evaluation benchmark by designing and applying a classification-based filtering scheme to unlabeled, real-world PDF documents (PDFA> (Montalvo &amp; Wightman, [> 2024
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib19)> )
), yielding7070k highly relevant pages across eight widely used domains —Finance, Legal, Healthcare, Commerce and Manufacturing, CRM, Energy, Education, and Construction—containing rich cross-modality content, including text, tables, and images.
We construct a knowledge graph that links cross-modality contents across documents via overlapping entities, and leverage these connections to synthesize 1,600 QA pairs spanning four question types:factual retrieval,comparison,summarization, andlogical reasoning, enabling multi-modality grounding and reflecting realistic retrieval scenarios.
To ensure quality,20%20\\%of the QA pairs are evaluated by three independent annotators for faithfulness, completeness, self-containment, human intent, and evidence usability, with disagreements resolved through expert adjudication.
Figure[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S3.F2)illustrates the full pipeline from PDF segmentation to dataset creation and evaluation.
In this paper, we compare text-only, image-only, multimodal joint, and text-image-fusion retrieval
augmented generation pipelines under a unified setup, using identical candidate pools, fixed top-kk, consistent prompts, and standardized evaluation criteria.
We report retrieval metrics (Recall@10,Precision@10), answercompletenessandfaithfulnessdefined at Section[4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S4.SS2).
We observe consistent gains for text–image-fusion RAG systems (completeness=68.4%68.4\\%) over multimodal joint retrieval systems (64.1%64.1\\%), text-retrieval systems (65.3%65.3\\%), and image-retrieval systems (54.5%54.5\\%).
This indicates that retrieving text and images separately using dedicated embeddings, then combining them in the final LLM query, outperforms unified embeddings or single-modality retrieval.
Moreover, visual evidence improves answer completeness and enhances faithfulness when paired with textual context, though image-only retrieval cannot fully capture the textual information contained in images.
Questions requiring images to answer remain challenging for all systems, suggesting that future RAG improvements should prioritize image-dependent queries. In contrast, performance differences across question types, such as comparison or factual retrieval, are minimal.

are typically limited to a single image or a single document page, covering narrow domains, under-representing modalities, or operating at limited scale with only a few queries or pages, as summarized in Table[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S1.T1). To address these gaps, we introduceUniDoc-Bench, a benchmark tailored to practical RAG use cases.
## 3Dataset Curation
First, a large-scale, high-quality multi-modal database is needed for evaluating RAG systems, where each document contains content-rich figures, tables and corresponding textual information. Documents should be domain-specific and exhibit high inter-document similarity to evaluate effective retrieval.
The construction of this database is detailed in Section[3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S3.SS1).
Then, we require high-quality query–answer pairs to evaluate the RAG system.
Each query is designed to reflect realistic human intent and is written as a self-contained question. The corresponding ground-truth answer must be retrievable solely from the curated database and supported by evidence across multiple modalities.
In Section[3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S3.SS2), we describe our synthetic QA pipeline, and in Section[3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S3.SS3), we validate dataset quality through human annotation.
### 3.1Source Document Collection
We use PDFA> (Montalvo &amp; Wightman, [> 2024
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib19)> )
as our data source, containing diverse formats (e.g., reports, slides, posters) and covering broad domains, but it lacks tags or labels.
Therefore, our first step is data filtering to collect a high-quality database.
We design a field scheme (see Appendix[B.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A2.SS1)) that captures key metadata, including domain, subdomain, language, modality (e.g., text, tables, figures), image quality (whether the resolution is clear), and text proportion. This allows us to standardize the data and build a high-quality cross-modality database.
As shown in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S1.F1)(c), we select88domains based on differences across industries and define many subdomains within each, grouping similar documents.
To ensure high inter-document similarity, we retain only documents from3​–​53–5related subdomains containing multiple modalities, yielding on average8,0008,000pages per domain.
The final dataset spansLegal, Commerce and Manufacturing, Education, Energy, Construction, Finance, Healthcare, and CRM, with detailed subdomain descriptions in Appendix[B.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A2.SS2).
![Refer to caption](x2.png)Figure 2:Data Construction pipeline. (a) We filter and tag PDFA documents to curate a high-quality database of7070k pages spanning88domains.
(b) We parse documents into text, figures, and tables, then synthesize initial QA pairs covering four question types and three modalities using adapted templates.
(c) We ground answers in supporting evidence, refine questions for human-intent and self-containment, and verify responses for factuality and completeness, yielding1,6001,600QA pairs. To ensure quality,20%20\\%of the dataset is validated by three independent human annotators.
### 3.2Question and Answer Synthesis Pipeline
As shown in Figure[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S3.F2), we introduce a data-synthesis pipeline for building multimodal RAG evaluation datasets with high-quality QA pairs, compatible with various document databases.
#### 3.2.1Evidence Collection
PDF Parsing.We first parse our curated PDF document database222https://unstructured.io/by extracting text chunks, tables, and figures, with the latter two stored separately as image files.
Within the parsed text chunk, each image and table is replaced with a unique placeholder tag (e.g.,&lt;&lt;fig-XXX&gt;&gt;or&lt;&lt;tab-XXX&gt;&gt;), along with its corresponding caption and parsed content to fully represent interleaved multimodal content.
An example of this parsing process is provided in Appendix[B.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A2.SS3).
Chunks Grouping.To support multimodal evidence QA, we construct a knowledge graph (𝒢i\\mathcal{G}\_{i})> (ExplodingGradients, [> 2024
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib2)> ; Peng et al., [> 2024
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib20)> )
over the parsed chunks for domainii, where nodes (Ni={ni​1,ni​2,…}N\_{i}=\\{n\_{i1},n\_{i2},...\\}) represent chunks and edges (EiE\_{i}) denote overlapping entities (e.g., “AI Agent Platform”).
Chunks across three modalities (text, tables, figures), from within or across documents, are linked to form ground-truth evidence, which are then used for QA synthesis in the next step.
#### 3.2.2Question and Answer Generation
Template Choice.First, we ensure the synthesized questions arediverseand span multiple categories, since focusing on a single category or using only the same few-shot example questions can introduce bias and limit the comprehensiveness of RAG evaluation.
We designed four RAG question types: 1)factual retrieval, 2)comparison, 3)summarization, and 4)logical reasoning.
For each question type and document domain, we design1010–1515general templates (see Appendix[B.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A2.SS4)).
We then sample linked chunks (ni​j,ei​j,ni​kn\_{ij},e\_{ij},n\_{ik}) and prompt the LLM to select11–33templates (Ti​jT\_{ij}) that best match the provided chunks and are most likely to produce QA pairs that humans would naturally ask, thereby improving both the diversity and coverage of the questions.
Evidence Grounding.To ensure comprehensive evaluation of MM-RAG, we design fouranswer typeswith distinct evidence requirements, each supported by specialized prompts:
* •Text-only: The question can be fully answered using natural language text from the documents.
* •Image-only: The question requires information exclusively from an image, such as numerical values shown only in a figure, thereby testing the system’s ability to interpret visual content.
* •Image-plus-text: Answering the question requires integrating information from both text and images, testing the model’s ability to reason across modalities.
* •Table-required: The question required tabular information to answer, requiring the system to understand table structure and content.
To construct QA pairs, we promptGPT-4.1with parsed text chunks and extracted figures/tables (PNG format), guided by promptsPnP\_{n}corresponding to the above answer types (see details in Appendix[B.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A2.SS5)) and templatesTi​jT\_{ij}.
We then employGemini-Pro-2.5— to mitigate single-LLM bias —to verify that the ground-truth answers are correctly grounded in the referenced text, tables, or images, ensuring factual correctness and re-classifying question types when necessary.
Rewriting.To ensure that questions areself-containedand reflect realistichuman intent, we refine the initially synthesized QA pairs.
In the first stage, many synthesized questions follow a long-context QA style and may include vague references such as “in this report” or “in Figure 8.”
To make them suitable for RAG evaluation, we rewrite these questions to ensure they are self-contained and understandable without external context (Appendix[B.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A2.SS6)).
Additionally, many QA pairs are grounded in images, leading to VQA-style questions (e.g., “How many logos are in Apple Inc.’s 2023 report?”). Such questions do not reflect natural human queries in a RAG context, so we filter and rewrite them to better align with realistic human intent.
To ensure comprehensive evaluation, ground-truth answers must becompleteanddiverse. In the final step, we revise answers to cover all relevant aspects of their corresponding questions (see Appendix[B.7](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A2.SS7)).
Deduplication and Balance.Additionally, we remove duplicated question–answer pairs that are highly similar in the question or the answer (similarity&gt;0.75&gt;0.75333https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
to maintain dataset quality and diversity.
We also rebalance the dataset by question type and answer type to provide a fair evaluation.
Dataset Statistics.Based on the above stages, we construct an evaluation benchmark consisting of200200QA pairs for each category, in total16001600QAs as described in Section[3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S3.SS1).
Within each set of200200QA pairs, we maintain an equal distribution of5050text-only, image-only, text-plus-image, and table-only questions.
In total, the dataset contains800800single-modality and800800multi-modality questions. On average, each question requires2.152.15evidence items (text chunks, images, or tables) for a complete answer, highlighting the need for RAG systems to retrieve multiple pieces of evidence. We further ensure a balanced distribution across the four main question types: factual retrieval, summarization, comparison, and logical reasoning.
More details can be found in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S1.F1)(b).
### 3.3Dataset Quality
We evaluate whether our constructed dataset is of sufficient quality to support reliable evaluation of different RAG systems
by sampling20%20\\%of our dataset—4040QA pairs from each domain, resulting in a total of320320QA pairs—for human evaluation.
We recruited33human annotators to evaluate the question–response pairs against the provided source documents.
In cases where33annotators disagreed, a44th senior reviewer mediated the discussion and guided the annotators toward a consensus decision.
For each item, annotators were directed to a folder containing all relevant source materials, including text extracted from PDF documents and associated images.
The annotation process involved assessing each question-response pair across five dimensions (More details about this human annotation task can be found in Appendix[C](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A3)):
* •Factuality: evaluates whether the claims made in the question (Factuality-Question) and the response (Factuality-Response) were factually supported by the source documents.
* •Completeness: assesses whether the response incorporates all necessary information from the retrieved sources to fully answer the question.
* •Grounding: assesses whether each source chunk (text, image, or table) used to generate the ground-truth response is necessary to answer the question, by labeling it as eitherrequiredornot required.
* •Self-Contained: assesses whether the question was understandable and answerable on its own, without needing external context beyond the provided documents.
* •Human-like Intent: evaluates whether the question reflected a natural, meaningful query that a human would plausibly ask to retrieve information.
Table 2:Human evaluation quality on a20%20\\%sample (n=320n{=}320). Each cell shows % and (count/320)

As shown in Table[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S3.T2), the sample shows near-perfect question factuality and self-containment, with strong response factuality and completeness (each≈\\approx294/320). Human-like intent remains high (312/320). Grounding label accuracy is solid (270/320) as well.
## 4Experiments
To fairly evaluate different RAG systems, we focus on two aspects: retrieval and end-to-end performance.
In this section, we first evaluate the retrieval performance of four embedding and retrieval models, including text-only, image-only, and two multimodal approaches (Section[4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S4.SS1)).
We then assess the end-to-end response performance of six RAG systems that vary in their use of embeddings, retrieval strategies, and LLMs (Section[4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S4.SS2)).
Together, these experiments highlight the utility of our dataset and provide practical guidance for selecting RAG components.
### 4.1Retrieval Performance
Baselines.We use the curated PDF documents as the knowledge base and the synthesized QA pairs to evaluate44embedding–retrieval models. For all methods, we retrieve the top-k=10k=10candidates.
* •Text:PDF pages are parsed into text chunks, each embedded with OpenAI’stext-embedding-3-small, and retrieved via vector search.
* •Image:Each PDF page is converted to a JPEG image, which is embedded usingColQwen2.5-v0.2> (Faysse et al., [> 2024b
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib5)> )
for image retrieval.
* •MM:Both text chunks and page-level images are embedded.
* –MM (GME): Text and images are jointly embedded usingGME-Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct> (Zhang et al., [> 2024a
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib34)> )
, enabling multimodal retrieval.
* –MM (T+I): A fusion baseline that selects the top-5 candidates from Text and the top-5 from Image retrieval.
Metrics.We reportPrecision@10andRecall@10as the retrieval metrics. Since no re-ranker is applied, recall is more informative thannDCGfor evaluation.
Since we need to evaluate both image and text retrieval, each retrieved text chunk or PDF image-page is mapped back to its original PDF page, and the ground-truth contexts are mapped in the same way.
Consequently, a retrieved chunk may span multiple consecutive pages of the source document (e.g., pages 2–3 of document A).
A retrieval is considered a true positive if the retrieved text chunk or image-page matches the ground-truth context in both page number and file.
This criterion may slightly inflateRecall@10, since partial overlaps (e.g., retrieved pages 1–3 vs. ground-truth pages 3–5, with the answer on page 5) are still treated as correct.
However, this approach offers the most practical and fair basis for comparing text and image retrieval.
Thus, absolute scores should not be overinterpreted; the key is the relative performance differences across methods, which remain reliable.

Table[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S4.T3)reports the retrieval performance of the four RAG embedding-retrieval models.
We observe thatimage-based retrieval achieves consistently higher recall but lower precision than text-based retrieval, as page-image chunks cover more information than individual text chunks.
Combining text and image retrieval (T++I) further improves both recall and precision, effectively leveraging the strengths of both modalities.
In contrast, multimodal embeddings (gme-Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct), which encode text and images jointly rather than separately, achieve comparable recall but substantially lower precision, suggesting that current multimodal embeddings still lag behind fusion of unimodal embeddings.
We also break down retrieval performance by question and answer types in Appendix[E.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A5.SS1).
### 4.2End-to-End Performance
Baselines.
* •Image-only RAG:Each PDF page is converted to a JPEG and retrieved via image embeddings.
* –Image-only RAG(IMG): Uses LlamaIndex withcolqwen2.5-v0.2> (Faysse et al., [> 2024b
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib5)> )
for image retrieval andGPT-4.1as the final MM-LLM. Each PDF page is converted to a JPEG image and embedded. After retrieval, the question and retrieved images are provided toGPT-4.1to obtain the final response.
* –VRAG> (Wang et al., [> 2025d
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib28)> )
: a multimodal RAG agent that leverages a vision-specific action space—including operations such as cropping and scaling—to iteratively extract information from image-formatted PDF pages in a coarse-to-fine manner. The embedding model iscolqwen2.5-v0.2, and the final LLM isGPT-4.1.
* •Text-only RAG:Most multimodal RAG studies> (Wang et al., [> 2025b

compare only against text-only baselines. For a fairer comparison, PDF pages are parsed into text chunks, embedded for retrieval, with associated images/tables linked back for final responses.
* –TEXT: Each text chunk is embedded usingtext-embedding-3-smalland retrieved. The retrieved text chunks, along with their associated images, are then fed intoGPT-4.1to generate the final response.
* –Vertex AI: following the official tutorial444https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/85643?parent=catalog,
PDFs are parsed into text and images, with images auto-captioned by Gemini. Only the text (document text and image captions) is indexed bytext-embedding-004and retrieved, and the retrieved chunks along with the corresponding images are passed togemini-2.5-flashfor final response.
* •MM-RAG:Both text chunks and image-format page images are embedded and retrieved for responses.
* –Multimodal Text-Image-Fusion RAG (T++I):Retrieves text and images separately usingtext-embedding-3-smallandcolqwen2.5-v0.2, then combines them for generation withGPT-4.1.
* –Multimodal-joint-Retrieval RAG(MM): Usesgme-Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct> (Zhang et al., [> 2024a
](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#bib.bib34)> )
as a multimodal embedding model for both text and image content. Unlike T++I, where text and images are embedded and retrieved separately, the text chunks and image-formatted PDF pages are embedded together, retrieved jointly, and then fed intoGPT-4.1for the final response.

Metrics.Forend-to-endperformance, we use an LLM-based judge to measure faithfulness and completeness.
Specifically, we first ask the LLM to extract the facts required to answer each question and then verify whether these facts are grounded in the ground-truth chunks; this is measured asfaithfulness.
Next, we ask the LLM to extract the facts required to answer the question from the ground-truth answer and then check whether each fact appears in the system’s response; this is measured ascompleteness. Higher faithfulness and completeness scores are better.
Table[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S4.T4)reports the completeness of responses generated by the six RAG systems under varying similarity top-kkretrieval settings.Text-only RAG(0.6530.653)substantially outperforms Image-only RAG systems(IMG:0.5450.545, VRAG:0.5460.546), highlighting the significant performance gap between text-based and image-based retrieval in current RAG architectures.
Although image retrieval achieves higher completeness at the retrieval stage, this advantage does not translate into better end-to-end performance, since multimodal LLMs (GPT-4.1) are more effective when processing text and image chunks together rather than page-level image PDFs alone.
The text-image-fusion RAG
achieves the best overall performance (0.6840.684) across eight domains, demonstrating that image-based PDF representations can effectively complement text retrieval.
Although VRAG leverages cropping and scaling to enhance image-based retrieval (0.5360.536for VRAG vs.0.5270.527for IMG (topk=10k=10)), it still lags behind the combined Text&amp;Image-Retrieval approach, underscoring the advantage of explicitly integrating both modalities.
Multimodal joint-retrieval RAG systems (MM;0.6410.641) also fall short of the simple combination of the best text and image embeddings.
This indicates that current multimodal embedding approaches still have substantial room for improvement, and that explicitlycombining separate text and image embeddings remains the most effective strategyfor leveraging multimodal documents.
More notably, multimodal-joint RAG (MM;0.6410.641) performs worse than text-only RAG (0.6530.653), demonstrating that current multimodal models still fall short of strong unimodal baselines.
These results also highlight the importance of establishing fair baselines and the value of our dataset: multimodal RAG systems should be benchmarked against strong, balanced baselines on diverse and high-quality datasets rather than against overly weak text-only settings.
Table[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S4.T5)shows that questions requiring only text are most effectively handled by RAG systems with text-embedding.Questions requiring tables are also relatively easy for RAG systems, as tables can be accurately parsed as text, which is a straightforward step before embedding documents for text-based retrieval.
In contrast, questions requiring images remain challenging across all embedding types —text, image, or multimodal —highlighting that futureRAG improvements should prioritize image-required questions.
We also observe thatquestion type has minimal impact on overall RAG performance.
We provide detailed case studies in Appendix[D](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A4).

### 4.3Additional findings
MM-RAG systems can offer both improved end-to-end performance and lower cost compared to
text-only RAG.As reported in Appendix[E.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A5.SS3), text-only RAG is the most expensive, image-only RAG has the lowest cost and latency, and multimodal RAG is cheaper than text-only RAG while maintaining comparable latency.
Open-source and commercial multimodal embeddings perform comparably.We compare RAG systems using different multimodal embeddings (Table[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A5.T8), Table[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A5.T9)) and find that the commercialvoyage-multimodal-3achieves similar performance to the open-sourceGME, though both still lag behind multimodal text–image fusion RAG systems.
Content-rich images increase difficulty.We classify images usinggemini-2.5-proas content-rich (containing information not in the text) or illustrative.
Content-rich images are more prevalent in finance (62.8%) and construction (69.3%) than in commerce manufacturing (40.0%) and legal (49.5%), indicating that domains with more content-rich images pose greater challenges for RAG, consistent with the results in Table[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S4.T4).
Details are in Appendix[F.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A6.SS1).
Question type affects difficulty.We further analyzed fined-grained evidence types and found that RAG performance depends on answer modality: text retrieval excels at entity recognition (53.9% better than image retrieval), comparative analysis (37.6%), contextual numerical reasoning (34.8%), and quantity estimation (29.1%), while image retrieval is stronger on chart/table interpretation (64.2% better than text retrieval), temporal trends (40.0%), and spatial/geographic reasoning (13.3%).
Detailed examples and analysis are in Appendix[D.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A4.SS1), Appendix[D.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A4.SS2)and Appendix[F.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A6.SS2).
We also summarize in Appendix[F](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A6)that single document page numbers and formats do not significantly affect MM-RAG performance.
## 5Conclusion
In this paper, we introducedUniDoc-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for document-centric multimodal RAG, built from7070k real-world PDF pages across88domains with1,6001,600human-verified QA pairs. Our experiments establish a clear performance hierarchy, showing thattext-image fusion RAG performs the best, consistently outperforming both joint multimodal (MM) RAG and single-modality RAG systems. This key finding demonstrates that fusing separate, strong retrievers for text and images is currently a more effective strategy than relying on a single joint multimodal embedding or a single modality alone. Our analysis further pinpoints image-dependent queries as the primary challenge for all systems. By providing a standardized platform for fair comparison,UniDoc-Benchserves as a crucial resource to guide the development of more robust and faithful document intelligence systems.

## Appendix AThe Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)
We used LLMs for three purposes: (i) polishing grammar and improving readability, and (ii) assisting in the evaluation of RAG outputs (iii) synthesizing the QA pairs. All research ideas and analyses were conducted by the authors, who take full responsibility for the content.
## Appendix BDataset Creation Details
### B.1Document fields
We classify each PDF document into the following fields:
* •domain: one or more from {Healthcare, Finance, Technology and Software, Commerce and Manufacturing, Marketing, Arts and Entertainment, Government, Legal, Education, Scientific Research and Development, Customer Relationship Management (CRM). others}
* •subdomain: optional finer-grained categories
* •date: year or estimated year (e.g., 2005)
* •language: language of the document (e.g.,en)
* •modality: possible values include {text, table, figure, formula, image, drawing}

### B.3Parsing Examples
We useunstructuredto parse each PDF into three components: text chunks, images of figures, and images of tables.
Since many figures (e.g., signatures or logos) are not informative, we only retain figures that include captions.
Figure[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A2.F3)shows an example of the parsing output, where figures are represented by placeholders such as&lt;&lt;fig-XXX&gt;&gt;and the parsed text from the figures.
![Refer to caption](figures/exp-parse.png)Figure 3:Example of PDF parsing with figure placeholders (&lt;&lt;fig-XXX&gt;&gt;).

If not, set"answer\_wrong"="True", else"False".Output Format:
```
{
"specific\_question":
"More specific version with essential keywords.",
"obscured\_question":
"Paraphrased version with reduced keyword overlap.",
"answer\_wrong": "True/False"
}
```
Example 1:Original: “What is the revenue growth shown in Figure 3 in 2024’s report?”
```

## Appendix CHuman Annotation
Annotators were provided with the following instructions to evaluate the quality of synthesized questions and responses against source documents.
### C.1Task Overview
The primary task is to read a synthesized question and response, then evaluate their quality based on the provided PDF pages and images. The core evaluation criterion is factuality.
### C.2Factuality Evaluation
Annotators must determine whether the question and response are factually supported by the source material.
#### C.2.1Procedure
Annotators were instructed to follow these steps:
1. 1.
Open the folder corresponding to the given ID.
2. 2.
Read the text from the PDF pages located in thechunk\_Xsubfolder. Annotators were told to read all text, including tables and image captions, but to ignore the content of the images themselves.
3. 3.
Review the images in theimg\_Xsubfolder to understand which image is being referenced, then locate that image within the source PDF to read its context and caption.
4. 4.
Read the provided Question and Response pair.
5. 5.
Assign a factuality label to both the question and the response.
#### C.2.2Label Definitions
Factuality-Question: Factual
All facts and claims in the question are directly supported by the source material. There are no hallucinations or unsupported statements.
Factuality-Question: Not Factual
One or more facts or claims in the question are not supported by the source (i.e., contain hallucinated or fabricated content).
Factuality-Response: Factual
All facts and claims in the response are directly supported by the source material. There are no hallucinations or unsupported statements.
Factuality-Response: Not Factual
One or more facts or claims in the response are not supported by the source (i.e., contain hallucinated or fabricated content).
Note:The original instructions included a rule stating, ”If a question or response is not factual, it should be labeled as ‘Incomplete’.” However, the provided examples use the ”Not Factual” label, which was the standard followed during annotation.
#### C.2.3Examples
The following examples were provided to the annotators for guidance.

### C.3Completeness Evaluation
This task assesses whether the response provides all the necessary information to fully answer the question, based on the provided source material.
#### C.3.1Procedure
The procedure for evaluating completeness is identical to the factuality task: annotators must review all provided PDF chunks and images before making a judgment.
#### C.3.2Label Definitions
Complete:
The response includes all the required facts and details present in the source material needed to comprehensively answer the question.
Incomplete:
The response omits one or more facts or claims that are present in the source and are necessary to fully answer the question.

### C.4Grounding Verification
For each question, annotators were required to verify which specific source materials (PDF text chunks or images) were necessary to formulate the answer.
#### C.4.1Procedure and Label Definitions
Grounding Verification-chunk-X:
After reading the question, the annotator must determine if the text content ofchunk\_X.pdfcontains any information used in, or required for, the answer.
* •Required:The chunk’s text contains information needed to answer the question.
* •Not Required:The chunk’s text does not contain any relevant information.
Grounding Verification-img-X:
The annotator must determine ifimg\_X(including its caption and context within the PDF) contains any information used in, or required for, the answer.
* •Required:The image or its caption contains information needed to answer the question.
* •Not Required:The image and its caption do not contain any relevant information.

### C.5Self-Contained Evaluation
This task assesses whether a question is understandable and complete on its own, without needing external context or references to specific, unnamed documents.
#### C.5.1Procedure
Annotators were instructed to read only the question and determine if it could be understood and answered without ambiguity, assuming one had access to a large database of documents.
#### C.5.2Label Definitions
True:
The question is self-contained. It is clearly phrased, makes sense on its own, and provides enough specific detail (e.g., names, topics, concepts) to be answerable. It does not rely on vague document references. For example, ”What are the key benefits of solar energy mentioned in the 2022 Department of Energy report?” is self-contained.
False:
The question depends on external or implicit context to be meaningful. It may contain vague deictic references (e.g., ”in the image above,” ”according to this chart,” ”what does this mean?”) without clarifying what the reference points to. For example, ”What is the logo in the image?” is not self-contained as it requires seeing a specific, un-referenced image.

### C.6Human-like Intent Evaluation
This task assesses whether a question reflects a natural and meaningful information-seeking intent, typical of a human user interacting with a document or database.
#### C.6.1Procedure
Annotators were instructed to read the question and judge its authenticity as a genuine human query. The focus was on the nature of the question’s intent rather than its grammatical perfection.
#### C.6.2Label Definitions
True:
The question represents a reasonable and natural query a human would make. It seeks meaningful information such as facts, summaries, comparisons, or explanations, and is phrased in a way that reflects a real information need. For example: ”What were the company’s main revenue streams in the last fiscal year?”
False:
The question is unnatural, trivial, or does not reflect a plausible human intent. This includes questions that are overly literal (e.g., counting word occurrences), focus on formatting (e.g., font sizes), are phrased robotically, or seek bizarrely specific details that a human would be unlikely to ask.

## Appendix EAdditional Experiments
### E.1Retrieval Performance
We break down retrieval performance by question and answer types, as reported in Table[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A5.T7).
We find that question type has minimal impact on retrieval recall, whereas answer type plays a significant role.
For text-only retrieval, performance is substantially higher on questions requiring text to answer, but markedly lower on image-required questions.
Conversely, for image-only retrieval, questions requiring image-based answers are retrieved more effectively than those requiring text, highlighting the modality-specific strengths of each embedding approach.
Combining both embeddings (T++I) effectively leverages the advantages of each modality, resulting in higher overall recall.
For multimodal embeddings, image-required questions tend to be retrieved more easily than text-required questions, suggesting that current multimodal embeddings function more like image retrieval in practice.

We compare RAG performance using two multimodal embeddings:voyage-multimodal-3andgme-Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, with results reported in Table[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A5.T8)and Table[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#A5.T9). Whilevoyage-multimodal-3achieves slightly lower recall but higher precision in retrieval compared togme-Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, it delivers better overall performance when integrated into MM-RAG.

### E.3Cost Comparison
We also calculate the average inference cost and latency of different RAG systems.
The image-only system (IMG) is the most efficient, while multimodal systems (MM) are the slowest, reflecting the trade-off between complexity and capability.
The text-only system consumes the most tokens and is therefore the most expensive. The T+I fusion RAG retrieves from text chunks first, then images, which increases latency. These results suggest that modern MM-RAG systems can offer both improved performance and lower cost compared to text-only RAG.

## Appendix FAdditional Analysis
### F.1Content-rich images increase difficulty
We analyzed all images in the documents of the easiest domain (commerce manufacturingandlegal) and the most difficult domains (financeandconstruction).
Usinggemini-2.5-pro, we classified images as either content-rich (providing information not present in the text) or illustrative.
In finance and construction, 62.8% and 69.3% of images, respectively, were content-rich, compared to 40.0% in commerce manufacturing and 49.5% in legal.
This suggests that domains with a higher proportion of content-rich images present a greater challenge for RAG, as these images require effective multimodal understanding beyond text.
### F.2Question type affects difficulty
As shown in Section[4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03663v2#S4.SS2), the type of context required to answer a question is the most significant factor influencing RAG performance.
Different categories of questions contribute unevenly to the advantage of either text- or image-retrieval RAG systems.
By carefully analyzing questions that can only be answered correctly by one of the two systems, we summarize the key distinguishing features:
Text-Retrieval Advantages:
* •Entity Recognition(e.g., brands, organizations; 53.9% of text advantage): Strong at identifying specific people, companies, or organizations.
* •Comparative Analysis(37.6%): Ranking, evaluating differences, or determining which option is preferable.
