## Summary

The webpage describes **QuantAgents**, a multi-agent financial system that integrates simulated trading. This system is designed to evaluate investment strategies and market scenarios without real risk. QuantAgents consists of four collaborating agents: a simulated trading analyst, a risk control analyst, a market news analyst, and a manager. The agents are incentivized based on performance in real-world markets and predictive accuracy in simulated trading. Experiments showed the framework achieved an overall return of nearly 300% over three years.

While the paper focuses on a multi-agent system for finance and simulated trading, it **does not mention** private equity, venture capital, due diligence automation, deal sourcing, portfolio monitoring, financial report generation, or specific integrations with PitchBook, AlphaSense, Preqin, CapIQ, or Bloomberg.

> In this paper, our objective is to develop a multi-agent financial system that incorporates simulated trading, a technique extensively utilized by financial professionals. While current LLM-based agent models demonstrate competitive performance, they still exhibit significant deviations from real-world fund companies. A critical distinction lies in the agents&#39; reliance on ``post-reflection&#39;&#39;, particularly in response to adverse outcomes, but lack a distinctly human capability: long-term prediction of future trends. Therefore, we introduce QuantAgents, a multi-agent system integrating simulated trading, to comprehensively evaluate various investment strategies and market scenarios without assuming actual risks. Specifically, QuantAgents comprises four agents: a simulated trading analyst, a risk control analyst, a market news analyst, and a manager, who collaborate through several meetings. Moreover, our system incentivizes agents to receive feedback on two fronts: performance in real-world markets and predictive accuracy in simulated trading. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework excels across all metrics, yielding an overall return of nearly 300% over the three years (
