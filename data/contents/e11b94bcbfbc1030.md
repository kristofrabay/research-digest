## Summary

The webpage describes a paper titled "MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS." This work addresses the challenges of using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** to augment the **strategic planning capability** of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Specifically, it notes that MCTS struggles with tasks like question answering where objective rewards are unavailable, and that achieving statistically significant results requires excessive token usage and time.

The proposed solution, MASTER, is a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication using **LLM specialized MCTS**. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity.

While the query covers broad topics like **reasoning and planning**, **chain-of-thought**, **inference-time compute**, **self-reflection**, **planning with LLMs**, **MCTS for language models**, **test-time scaling**, **hallucination reduction and detection**, **grounding**, and **factuality**, the provided text focuses primarily on **planning with LLMs** and **MCTS for language models**, and demonstrates improved performance on question-answering tasks (HotpotQA and WebShop).

> Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, which leads to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot yield an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present the Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication through LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. Comments:|Accepted by main NAACL 2025|
