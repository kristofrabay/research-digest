## Summary

The provided webpage focuses on **AgentCore Memory** within **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**, which is a fully managed service that enables AI agents to remember past interactions for more intelligent and context-aware conversations.

It details two types of memory:
1.  **Short-term memory:** Captures turn-by-turn interactions within a single session.
2.  **Long-term memory:** Automatically extracts and stores key insights across multiple sessions for persistent knowledge retention (e.g., user preferences).

The key benefits include creating more natural conversations, delivering personalized experiences, and reducing development complexity by managing conversational state. Common use cases mentioned are conversational agents, task-oriented/workflow agents, multi-agent systems, and autonomous/planning agents. The page also notes that AgentCore Memory supports a variety of SDKs and agent frameworks.

**Regarding your specific query terms:**

The page **does not** mention or discuss: **agent\_infrastructure: MCP servers, tool use, agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents SDK, Anthropic Agents SDK, Google SDK), function calling, structured outputs, or agent orchestration** (though it mentions "task-oriented / workflow agents" and "multi-agent systems" as use cases). It focuses specifically on the memory component of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

**Summary relevant to the page content:** The page describes how Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory provides short-term and long-term memory capabilities to AI agents to maintain context and personalize interactions, addressing the challenge of statelessness in agentic AI.

**No answer found** for the majority of the specific infrastructure and framework terms listed in your query.

# Add memory to your Amazon Bedrock AgentCore agent
AgentCore Memory is a fully managed service that gives your AI agents the ability to
remember past interactions, enabling them to provide more intelligent, context-aware,
and personalized conversations. It provides a simple and powerful way to handle both
short-term context and long-term knowledge retention without the need to build or manage
complex infrastructure.
AgentCore Memory addresses a fundamental challenge in agentic AI: statelessness. Without
memory capabilities, AI agents treat each interaction as a new instance with no
knowledge of previous conversations. AgentCore Memory provides this critical capability,
allowing your agent to build a coherent understanding of users over time.

AgentCore Memory supports a variety of SDKs and agent frameworks. For examples,
see[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory examples](./memory-examples.html).
## Memory types
AgentCore Memory offers[two types](./memory-types.html)of memory that
work together to create intelligent, context-aware AI agents:
**Short-term memory**
Short-term memory captures turn-by-turn interactions within a single
session. This lets agents maintain immediate context without requiring users
to repeat information.
**Example:**When a user asks, "What's the
weather like in Seattle?" and follows up with "What about tomorrow?", the
agent relies on recent conversation history to understand that "tomorrow"
refers to the weather in Seattle.
**Long-term memory**
Long-term memory automatically extracts and stores key insights from
conversations across multiple sessions, including user preferences,
important facts, and session summaries —for persistent knowledge retention
across multiple sessions.
**Example:**If a customer mentions they
prefer window seats during flight booking, the agent stores this preference
in long-term memory. In future interactions, the agent can proactively offer
window seats, creating a personalized experience.
## Memory key benefits
* **Create more natural conversations:**By
remembering previous turns in a conversation, agents can understand context,
resolve ambiguous statements, and interact in a way that feels more
human.
* **Deliver personalized experiences:**Retain user
preferences, historical data, and key facts across sessions to tailor responses
and actions to individual users.
* **Reduce development complexity:**Offload the
undifferentiated heavy lifting of managing conversational state and memory,
allowing you to focus on building your agent's core business logic.
## Common use cases of memory
* **Conversational agents:**A customer support
chatbot remembers a user's previous issues and preferences, enabling it to
provide more relevant assistance in future interactions.
* **Task-oriented / workflow agents:**An AI agent
orchestrating a multi-step business process, such as invoice approval, uses
memory to track the status of each step and maintain workflow progress.
* **Multi-agent systems:**A team of AI agents
managing a supply chain shares memory to synchronize inventory levels,
anticipate demand, and optimize logistics.
* **Autonomous or planning agents:**An autonomous
vehicle uses memory to plan routes, adjust to traffic conditions, and learn from
past experiences to improve future driving decisions.
