## Summary

The webpage describes a paper titled "Faithful Question Answering with Monte-Carlo Planning" which proposes **FAME** (FAithful question answering with MontE-carlo planning). This method aims to answer questions based on **faithful reasoning steps** organized as a structured entailment tree. It formulates the task as a discrete decision-making problem solved by a controller interacting with a reasoning environment. A **Monte-Carlo planning algorithm** is introduced to perform look-ahead search and select actions that lead to high-quality steps.

While the user query covers broad topics like **Reasoning LLMs, chain-of-thought, inference-time compute, self-reflection, planning with LLMs, MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for language models, test-time scaling, hallucination reduction and detection, grounding, and factuality**, the paper specifically focuses on:

*   **Planning with LLMs** (using Monte-Carlo planning for action selection).
*   **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for language models** (explicitly using a Monte-Carlo planning algorithm).
*   **Faithfulness** and producing valid reasoning steps (related to grounding and factuality in the context of QA).

The paper does not explicitly detail reasoning LLMs, chain-of-thought, inference-time compute, self-reflection, test-time scaling, or hallucination reduction/detection beyond the scope of producing faithful reasoning steps for question answering.

> Abstract:Although large language models demonstrate remarkable question-answering performances, revealing the intermediate reasoning steps that the models faithfully follow remains challenging. In this paper, we propose FAME (FAithful question answering with MontE-carlo planning) to answer questions based on faithful reasoning steps. The reasoning steps are organized as a structured entailment tree, which shows how premises are used to produce intermediate conclusions that can prove the correctness of the answer. We formulate the task as a discrete decision-making problem and solve it through the interaction of a reasoning environment and a controller. The environment is modular and contains several basic task-oriented modules, while the controller proposes actions to assemble the modules. Since the search space could be large, we introduce a Monte-Carlo planning algorithm to do a look-ahead search and select actions that will eventually lead to high-quality steps. FAME achieves state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark. It can produce valid and faithful reasoning steps compared with large language models with a much smaller model size.
