## Akira AI Multi-agent in action

1\. Master Orchestrator Agent The central command unit that directs respectively, the overall automation of the compliance process. It would accord with agentic workflow by delegating the tasks to other agents so that at every stage in the compliance process each step is derived free of any errors.

It relies on an LLM for higher-order decision-making. The knowledge graph captures the compliance data, rules, and relationships related to this domain and integrates the results into the Master Orchestrator Agent. This agent ensures that all the subprocesses are executed in a fashion compliant with regulations.

2\. KYC and Due Diligence Agent The agent commissions it by onboarding the customer, performing very elaborate due diligence, and Know Your Customer checks for boarding each and every individual. It also sends API calls to external systems to verify an individual's identity and background check.

The solution utilizes an LLM that is specialized for compliance procedures and automates due diligence with minimal human touch, ensuring very high accuracy. In agent verification, the agent chooses either to accept or reject the onboarding process. 3\. Risk Assessment and Data Security Agent  This agent ensures the continuity and independence of the review regarding the occurrence of any potential risks concerning data security-related risk assessment.This agent is using a pre-trained domain LLM on financial regulations and risk management protocols.

It uses the rules-based system to ensure operations meet the standard in the industry. It checks if data processes meet compliance requirements through generating reports or alerting whether devices are not working accordingly.

4\. Transaction Monitoring and Sanctions Screening Agent

This agent autonomously monitors transactions in real-time, ensuring that all financial activities comply with sanctions and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. It flags any suspicious transactions for further investigation. If a transaction is flagged, the agent autonomously prepares and submits a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) and alerts the compliance team.

5\. Final Processing

After all the agents have finished their processing, a final data compliance check is performed. This ensures that all necessary information has been collected and verified according to regulatory standards. The system then proceeds to generate a comprehensive report summarizing the compliance process and its findings.

This report includes details from various stages of the compliance workflow, such as KYC results, risk assessments, and any flagged transactions. The system marks the compliance process as done. If any suspicious activities were detected during the process, the SAR Filing and Reporting Agent prepares and submits a Suspicious Activity Report to the appropriate authorities.
