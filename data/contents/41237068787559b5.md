## Summary

The webpage describes the **Chart data extraction pipeline** offered by the Reducto API, which uses a multi-stage process combining OCR and **vision-language models (VLMs)** to extract structured data from chart images.

The pipeline has three main stages:
1.  **Structural Analysis:** Uses OCR for text detection (labels, titles) and layout understanding to establish coordinate system boundaries.
2.  **Coordinate Extraction:** Uses computer vision techniques to detect precise coordinates for data elements (e.g., bar heights, line endpoints).
3.  **Semantic Correspondence:** A fine-tuned **VLM** validates the extracted coordinates and maps them to their semantic meaning using mark prompting, handling ambiguities and transforming pixel coordinates into actual data values based on axis scales.

The pipeline adapts its processing based on the chart type (e.g., VLMs take on more responsibility for pie charts). The output is structured data in a **tabular markdown table format**.

# Chart data extraction pipeline

An overview of Reducto’s chart data extraction
Copy page
Our chart extraction feature uses a multi-stage pipeline that combines OCR with vision-language models to extract structured data from chart images. The system processes diverse chart types through adaptive workflows, delivering accurate data extraction for enterprise analytics workflows.## [​
](#architecture-overview)
Architecture overview
The extraction pipeline consists of three primary stages:
1. **Structural Analysis**- OCR-based text detection and layout understanding
2. **Coordinate Extraction**- Key point detection and spatial mapping
3. **Semantic Correspondence**- Vision-language model validation and data mapping![Chart Extraction Pipeline Architecture](https://cdn.reducto.ai/documentation_images/chart-blog/pipeline-architecture.svg)## [​
](#stage-1:-structural-analysis)
Stage 1: Structural analysis
The process starts with OCR to detect and segment text elements—axis labels, titles, legends, and data annotations. The system analyzes the spatial positioning of these elements to understand the chart’s structure and establish coordinate system boundaries. Based on this layout analysis, we segment the chart into regions and identify the primary visualization area.![OCR Text Detection and Segmentation](https://cdn.reducto.ai/documentation_images/chart-blog/ocr-segmentation-example%201.svg)Key outputs from this stage include:
* Bounding boxes for all text elements
* Axis orientation and scale detection
* Chart type classification
* Coordinate system boundaries## [​
](#stage-2:-coordinate-extraction)
Stage 2: Coordinate extraction
Following structural analysis, the system performs key point detection to extract precise coordinates for data elements. This includes:
* Bar heights and positions in bar charts
* Line segment endpoints and inflection points
* Pie slice boundaries and centroids
* Scatter plot point locations![Key Point Detection and Coordinate Extraction](https://cdn.reducto.ai/documentation_images/chart-blog/keypoint-detection-example%201.svg)The coordinate extraction module uses computer vision techniques to identify these elements within the segmented regions established in Stage 1. Each detected point is stored with its pixel coordinates and confidence score.## [​
](#stage-3:-semantic-correspondence)
Stage 3: Semantic correspondence
A fine-tuned vision-language model processes the extracted coordinates using mark prompting techniques. This step establishes the correspondence between detected key points and their associated data labels, ensuring accurate mapping between visual elements and their semantic meaning.The model handles common challenges including:
* Ambiguous label-to-data associations
* Overlapping or clustered data points
* Irregular label positioning
* Multi-series data disambiguationAfter validation, the system transforms the coordinates from pixel space to actual data values using the established axis scales from Stage 1.## [​
](#adaptive-processing-by-chart-type)
Adaptive processing by chart type
The pipeline adapts its processing strategy based on the detected chart type:**Bar and Line Charts**: The coordinate extraction and mapping stages handle most processing, with the VLM primarily validating correspondences. The system leverages the regular structure of these charts for efficient processing.**Pie Charts**: The vision-language model takes on additional responsibilities, directly interpreting angular relationships and percentage allocations that would be difficult to capture through coordinate analysis alone.**Complex Visualizations**: For stacked charts, heatmaps, and other complex formats, the pipeline dynamically adjusts the balance between rule-based extraction and model-based interpretation.## [​
](#output-format)
Output format
The pipeline produces structured data in a tabular markdown table format. Each extraction includes:
* Column headers mapped from axis labels and legends
* Row data containing the extracted values
* Metadata including chart title and data source when available## [​
](#performance-characteristics)
Performance characteristics
The system maintains high accuracy across diverse chart formats encountered in enterprise environments. Processing time varies by chart complexity. The pipeline includes built-in validation steps to ensure data quality and consistency across the extraction process.
