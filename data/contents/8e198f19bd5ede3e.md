## Summary

The webpage describes a paper titled "Interpretable Contrastive Monte Carlo Tree Search Reasoning," which proposes **SC-MCTS***, a novel **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** reasoning algorithm for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

The work addresses:
1.  The slower speed of previous MCTS LLM reasoning methods compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
2.  The limited quantitative analysis of MCTS components from an interpretability perspective.
3.  The crucial role of the reward model in MCTS.

The authors conducted ablation studies and introduced:
*   A highly **interpretable reward model** based on contrastive decoding.
*   An average **51.9% speed improvement** per node using speculative decoding.
*   Improvements to the UCT node selection strategy and backpropagation.

This new method, SC-MCTS*, outperformed a baseline (o1-mini) by an average of **17.4%** on the Blocksworld multi-step reasoning dataset using Llama-3.1-70B.

In summary, the page focuses on **MCTS for language models** and improvements in **reasoning** speed and interpretability.

> We propose SC-MCTS*: a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) reasoning algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly improves both reasoning accuracy and speed. Our motivation comes from: 1. Previous MCTS LLM reasoning works often overlooked its biggest drawback--slower speed compared to CoT; 2. Previous research mainly used MCTS as a tool for LLM reasoning on various tasks with limited quantitative analysis or ablation studies of its components from reasoning interpretability perspective. 3. The reward model is the most crucial component in MCTS, however previous work has rarely conducted in-depth study or improvement of MCTS&#39;s reward models. Thus, we conducted extensive ablation studies and quantitative analysis on components of MCTS, revealing the impact of each component on the MCTS reasoning performance of LLMs. Building on this, (i) we designed a highly interpretable reward model based on the principle of contrastive decoding and (ii) achieved an average speed improvement of 51.9% per node using speculative decoding. Additionally, (iii) we improved UCT node selection strategy and backpropagation used in previous works, resulting in significant performance improvement. We outperformed o1-mini by an average of 17.4% on the Blocksworld multi-step reasoning dataset using Llama-3.1-70B with SC-MCTS*. Our code is available at [> this https URL
