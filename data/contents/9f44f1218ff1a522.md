## Summary

The webpage describes a paper titled "Chart-based Reasoning: Transferring Capabilities from LLMs to VLMs." The research proposes a technique to transfer reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically addressing the limited reasoning abilities of smaller VLMs.

The method involves:
1. Improving chart representation by continuing pre-training using an improved chart-to-table translation task.
2. Constructing a much larger dataset.
3. Synthesizing reasoning traces using the table representation of charts to improve general reasoning and numerical operations.
4. Fine-tuning the model using a multitask loss.

The resulting model, **ChartPaLI-5B**, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ChartQA dataset and shows significant improvements on PlotQA and FigureQA. Furthermore, when rationales are refined, the model outperforms **Gemini Ultra** and **GPT-4V**.

While the page discusses **Vision-language models (VLMs)**, **chart/table extraction** (implied by chart-to-table translation), and **report generation** (implied by reasoning and output capabilities), it does not explicitly detail **multimodal RAG**, **document understanding**, **PDF parsing**, or the specific use of **Claude vision** or **structured document output** beyond chart reasoning.

> Vision-language models (VLMs) are achieving increasingly strong performance on multimodal tasks. However, reasoning capabilities remain limited particularly for smaller VLMs, while those of large-language models (LLMs) have seen numerous improvements. We propose a technique to transfer capabilities from LLMs to VLMs. On the recently introduced ChartQA, our method obtains state-of-the-art performance when applied on the PaLI3-5B VLM by \citet{chen2023pali3}, while also enabling much better performance on PlotQA and FigureQA.
> We first improve the chart representation by continuing the pre-training stage using an improved version of the chart-to-table translation task by \citet{liu2023deplot}. We then propose constructing a 20x larger dataset than the original training set. To improve general reasoning capabilities and improve numerical operations, we synthesize reasoning traces using the table representation of charts. Lastly, our model is fine-tuned using the multitask loss introduced by \citet{hsieh2023distilling}.
> Our variant ChartPaLI-5B outperforms even 10x larger models such as PaLIX-55B without using an upstream OCR system, while keeping inference time constant compared to the PaLI3-5B baseline. When rationales are further refined with a simple program-of-thought prompt \cite{chen2023program}, our model outperforms the recently introduced Gemini Ultra and GPT-4V.
