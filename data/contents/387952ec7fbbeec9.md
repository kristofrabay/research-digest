# LlamaIndex vs LangChain: RAG framework differences
Fri Oct 31 2025
![](https://images.ctfassets.net/083zfbgkrzxz/69Ykeiv522qAAezxMPi0ya/db6f8535decfb4aa59aceab283ffdc5b/image.png)
LLMs are great at talking. They are less great at knowing. That mismatch shows up fast when a bot needs to answer real questions from product docs, contracts, or knowledge bases with dates and version numbers that matter.**Retrieval-augmented generation fixes the gap by bringing a model the right facts at the right moment.**The tricky part is picking a framework and proving it works without spiraling cost or complexity.
This piece breaks down where RAG delivers value, how LlamaIndex and LangChain actually differ, and a practical way to build and evaluate a pipeline that holds up in production. Expect opinions, tradeoffs, and steps you can run this week.
## Why retrieval-augmented generation matters
RAG connects an LLM to your domain data so answers are fresh, scoped, and auditable. The Pragmatic Engineer has a clean overview of the pattern and why it became the default for production AI features[link](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag). In short,**you pull sources first, then let the model write with evidence**. That sequence cuts hallucinations, keeps answers tied to citations, and removes the need to retrain every time a policy changes.
IBM’s comparison of LlamaIndex and LangChain frames RAG as a retrieval-first discipline that prizes precision and traceability[link](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llamaindex-vs-langchain). The focus on retrieval quality matters more than clever prompts. When the source set is right, the model’s job is easier and cheaper.
Framework choice pushes you toward different strengths. LlamaIndex keeps indexing and query flow tight; LangChain leans into orchestration, tools, and memory. Guides from DataCamp, Medium, and AIMultiple walk through the tradeoffs with concrete examples and early benchmarks[links: DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/langchain-vs-llamaindex),[Medium](https://medium.com/@tam.tamanna18/langchain-vs-llamaindex-a-comprehensive-comparison-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-0adc119363fe),[AIMultiple](https://research.aimultiple.com/rag-frameworks). Field reports in The Pragmatic Engineer’s look at AI engineering show teams converging on retrieval-first stacks with explicit citations and guardrails[link](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-in-the-real-world).
Here’s the quick rule of thumb:
* For document-heavy tasks with clear answers, LlamaIndex tends to be the simpler, sharper tool[links: IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llamaindex-vs-langchain),[n8n](https://blog.n8n.io/llamaindex-vs-langchain/).
* For complex workflows that need tools, memory, or agents, LangChain usually scales better, a point echoed by the community[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1bbog83/langchain_vs_llamaindex/).
## Key differences in LlamaIndex and LangChain architectures
LlamaIndex is retrieval-first. It centers on document ingestion, flexible indexes, and fast query-time routing so the model sees the right chunks with minimal overhead. IBM’s write-up highlights this efficiency and the straight path from docs to precise answers[link](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llamaindex-vs-langchain).
LangChain is orchestration-first. It offers chains, agents, memory, and tool calling, which is ideal for multi-step flows or when a bot needs to browse, call APIs, or reason over several hops. DataCamp’s guide captures this modular style and the extra control knobs it brings[link](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/langchain-vs-llamaindex).
Both rely on vector embeddings, but the posture differs:
* LlamaIndex ships sensible defaults that work out of the box, then lets you swap components as needs grow. Lower setup tax, faster time to first useful answer.
* LangChain exposes more choices up front: vector stores, retrievers, memory types, and agent behaviors. More control, more responsibility.
That split shows up in latency, failure modes, and tuning effort. If recall dips or latency spikes, the fix could be chunking or index type rather than the model itself. Benchmarks at AIMultiple and war stories across r/LangChain and r/RAG point to the same theme:**optimize retrieval first, then worry about agent cleverness**[links: AIMultiple](https://research.aimultiple.com/rag-frameworks),[r/LangChain](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1bbog83/langchain_vs_llamaindex/),[r/RAG](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rag/comments/1g2h7s8/for_rag_devs_langchain_or_llamaindex/).
## Practical steps for building integrated pipelines
Start with clean, purposeful chunks. Use headings to define scope and keep each chunk self-contained so a retriever can stand on it without cross-references. Most teams land between 300 and 800 tokens, then adjust based on question types and model context limits. The Pragmatic Engineer’s primer offers a solid mental model for this setup[link](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag).
A simple build plan that works:
1. Define the questions: pull 30 to 50 real queries from docs and tickets to form a coverage set.
2. Chunk and index: start with small overlap, then expand if recall is low. Pick an index aligned to the task, like QA or summarization, as described in IBM and DataCamp’s comparisons[links: IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llamaindex-vs-langchain),[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/langchain-vs-llamaindex).
3. Choose embeddings: smaller models are cheaper and faster; larger models usually lift recall. AIMultiple’s roundup is helpful for tradeoffs[link](https://research.aimultiple.com/rag-frameworks).
4. Run retrieval-only tests: measure precision and recall at k, then tweak chunk size, overlap, and metadata.
5. Wire generation with citations: instruct the model to quote sources and include links.
6. Add guardrails and evaluation: track latency, token cost, and answer quality on a rolling sample. Many teams use Statsig experiments to compare RAG variants in production and protect guardrail metrics like resolution rate and time to answer before scaling traffic.
Here’s what typically goes wrong:
* Missed hits: chunk size is off or overlap is too small. Increase overlap and add title metadata to boost recall.
* Irrelevant hits: embeddings or metadata are noisy. Clean HTML, remove boilerplate, and add section headers as tags.
* Slow queries: wrong index or store settings. Switch to a faster vector store, trim k, or cache common queries.
When mixing frameworks, keep roles clear. Use LlamaIndex for ingestion and retrieval, then orchestrate prompts, tools, and agents elsewhere if needed. The n8n overview and IBM comparison both outline clean splits that avoid spaghetti pipelines[links: n8n](https://blog.n8n.io/llamaindex-vs-langchain/),[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llamaindex-vs-langchain). Statsig customers often wire these variants into A/B tests so changes to chunking, embeddings, or prompts are measured on real traffic with cost and quality guardrails in place.
## Evaluating framework suitability for diverse scenarios
Choose by scenario, not fashion. LlamaIndex drills into document stores with low overhead and fast answers[link](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llamaindex-vs-langchain). LangChain stretches across multi-step flows with tools and memory, at the cost of extra setup and tuning[link](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/langchain-vs-llamaindex).
A few common cases:
* Need fast answers from a relatively static corpus: pick LlamaIndex for precision and simplicity. AIMultiple’s benchmark notes the overhead benefits[link](https://research.aimultiple.com/rag-frameworks).
* Need tools, agents, or long-term memory: go with LangChain. Community threads back the flexibility when workflows get hairy[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1bbog83/langchain_vs_llamaindex/).
* Document-heavy search and QA: LlamaIndex keeps retrieval precise with minimal ceremony[links: IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llamaindex-vs-langchain),[n8n](https://blog.n8n.io/llamaindex-vs-langchain/).
* Multi-tenant assistants with guardrails, routing, and tool use: LangChain’s modular patterns pay off[links: DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/langchain-vs-llamaindex),[Medium](https://medium.com/@tam.tamanna18/langchain-vs-llamaindex-a-comprehensive-comparison-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-0adc119363fe).
A hybrid often wins. Pull retrieval through LlamaIndex, then orchestrate a chain or agent in LangChain when you need tools or multi-step reasoning. Real-world stacks in The Pragmatic Engineer’s report reflect this pragmatic split between tight retrieval and flexible control[link](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-in-the-real-world).
Validate fit with small probes and hard numbers. Track retrieval hit rate, token cost, latency budgets, and answer usefulness against a fixed question set, as suggested in The Pragmatic Engineer’s guide[link](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag). Once the metrics hold up, ramp traffic in stages and keep guardrails visible.**Pick the framework that matches your workflow, not the hype.**
## Closing thoughts
RAG earns its keep by grounding LLMs in the facts that matter. LlamaIndex shines when the job is tight retrieval and fast answers; LangChain shines when the job is orchestration with tools and memory.**Start simple: retrieval first, then layer complexity only when the use case demands it.**Treat retrieval quality as the product, not an implementation detail.
