Building the RAG pipeline is easy, but making it useful in real life is hard. 💻One of the aspects that is often overlooked while building them is the 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐲.🔧
Chunking is essential as it segments large documents into manageable units. Organizing text into smaller chunks allows the system to retrieve only the most relevant parts during inference, improving the efficiency of responses. Chunking basically ensures the RAG model uses relevant data and improves output quality without overwhelming it with irrelevant information.
Here are nine different chunking strategies that you should know:
↳𝐅𝐢𝐱𝐞𝐝-𝐒𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠Divides text into uniform-length segments (e.g., by word or token count), ensuring predictable and simple chunk sizes but risking semantic fragmentation.
↳𝐒𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞-𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠Splits text into complete sentences, preserving semantic meaning, though chunk sizes may vary and depend on sentence length.
↳𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜-𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠Groups text based on semantic similarity (using embeddings), ensuring contextual relevance but at the cost of higher computational resources.
↳𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠Iteratively breaks down text until size limits are met, ensuring compliance with size constraints but potentially leading to over-fragmentation.
↳ 𝐒𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠-𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠Uses overlapping chunks to preserve context across boundaries, though it increases redundancy and computational overhead.
↳𝐇𝐢𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠Utilizes a document’s natural structure (e.g., sections and paragraphs) to create nested chunks, preserving logical flow but requiring well-structured documents.
↳𝐓𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐜-𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠Clusters text into thematic groups based on topic modeling, improving thematic consistency but potentially introducing ambiguity from overlapping topics.
↳𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲-𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠Separates mixed-content documents (e.g., text, images, tables) into modality-specific chunks, ensuring integrity but adding complexity to the processing pipeline.
↳𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠Uses AI agents to dynamically identify chunk boundaries, offering flexibility and human-like chunking decisions, but at a higher cost and processing time.

2023 was about building RAG systems that worked.
2025 is about making them think, reason and retrieve like humans.
Here’s what’s changing and why it’s reshaping AI infrastructure 1. Semantic Chunking
Forget token limits. The future is meaning based chunking.
Instead of cutting by size, we split text by idea.
It improves retrieval accuracy by 20–30% and reduces hallucinations.
2. HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)
When a user asks a vague question, the system first imagines a detailed answer, embeds that, and then retrieves the real documents.
It’s like search powered by imagination.
3. Rerankers (like Cohere Rerank 3.5)
Your vector database gets you close. The reranker gets you right.
It reorders the top 100 candidates based on context.
Precision up. Hallucinations down.
4. Fine Tuned Embeddings
Generic embeddings are so 2024.
Teams now fine tune models for their domain such as finance, legal or biotech and see 5–10% better retrieval.
5. Hybrid Search
Keyword plus semantic equals the perfect match.
Combining BM25 with embeddings balances precision and recall.
6. Graph RAG
Instead of flat chunks, think knowledge graphs.
Nodes, edges, and relationships that enable multi hop reasoning and factual grounding.
7. Agentic RAG
RAG that plans, reasons and retrieves iteratively from various sources
Agents break complex questions into steps, re query, verify and self correct.
Basically, RAG meets ReAct.
8. Filtered Semantic Search
Add filters like date, author or domain to embeddings.
Retrieve only what’s relevant right now.
That’s how enterprise RAGs keep latency low and results fresh.
9. CAG (Cache Augmented Generation)
The opposite of RAG.
Preload the full context, compute caches once, and generate instantly.
No retrieval, no database. Perfect for static knowledge bases.
10. Instruction Embedding Models
Tell your embedding model what to care about, literally.
“Retrieve scientific papers about…”
“Embed this as a legal argument…”
Zero shot adaptation, no fine tuning needed.
11. Context Compression
Less is more.
Before feeding documents to your LLM, distill them down to what truly matters.
You save tokens, time, and improve focus.
Every one of these innovations reduces hallucinations, improves recall or speeds up generation.

Step 1: How I Solved the Hidden Bottleneck in My RAG System —Smart Document Parsing 🧠📄When I started building my Agentic Graph RAG system, I assumed the toughest part would be tuning embeddings or optimizing retrieval.
I was wrong.
The real challenge hit me earlier —getting PDFs to talk sense.
What looked like a simple “just extract the text” task turned into a deep dive into the chaos of scattered columns, broken tables, and unreadable scans. That’s when I realized:
Most RAG systems fail long before retrieval —right at the data-ingestion step.
The Problem I Faced
PDFs are a nightmare for AI systems:
Text is scattered across columns
Tables lose their structure
Scanned documents need OCR
Images and charts mixed with text
I tried the usual tools - PyMuPDF, PDFMiner. Each one solved ONE problem but created three more. I was building a Frankenstein pipeline just to read documents.
What Actually Worked
I switched to LlamaParse and it changed everything.
Instead of chaining 5 different tools, I made ONE API call. That's it.
LlamaParse uses LLMs to understand the document like a human would. It handles text, tables, images, and even scanned PDFs automatically.
Here's the difference:
Before: PyMuPDF →PDFMiner →[Unstructured.io](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http://Unstructured.io&amp;urlhash=ZNpn&amp;trk=public_post-text)→ Tesseract →Custom code to merge everything (fragile mess)
After: LlamaParse API call →Clean, structured text (just works)
Why This Matters
Bad parsing = Bad knowledge extraction = Bad answers
Your fancy LLM and vector database won't save you if the input is garbage.
I learned this the hard way after debugging why my system kept giving weird answers. Turned out, my table parsing was breaking the data structure.
The Real Lesson
Don't overcomplicate the basics. Sometimes paying for a good API beats building a complex system yourself.
My parsing pipeline went from 200 lines of fragile code to 20 lines that actually work.
This is Step 1 of building my Agentic Graph RAG system. Next up: adding contextual summaries to make retrieval smarter.

Step 2: Why My RAG System Was Giving Terrible Answers (and How I Fixed It)
In my last post, I shared how I’m parsing PDFs for my Agentic Graph RAG —a production-grade retrieval-augmented generation system 👉check out the step 1 :[https://lnkd.in/gpnAvePX](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https://lnkd.in/gpnAvePX&amp;urlhash=Tydr&amp;trk=public_post-text)Today’s post is about the next (painful) lesson:
Why parsing alone wasn’t enough.
🧩The Problem I Discovered
My system could read documents perfectly.
But when someone asked a question, it would return completely irrelevant chunks of text.
Example:
Question: “What are the benefits of using knowledge graphs?”
Returned: A random paragraph that mentioned “graph” once but was actually about data visualization.
The retrieval was technically working —it just wasn’t context-aware.
🔍What Was Actually Happening
When you split a document into chunks, you lose context.
It’s like reading a paragraph from the middle of a book with no title, no introduction, no clue about what’s happening.
That’s exactly what my vector database was storing.
A chunk that says:
“This approach improved accuracy by 40%”
…is meaningless without knowing:
What approach?
Accuracy of what?
Compared to what baseline?
🧠The Fix: Contextual Retrieval
Before storing each chunk, I introduced contextual summaries —inspired by[Anthropic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/anthropicresearch?trk=public_post-text)’s contextual retrieval approach and implemented using[Cohere](https://ca.linkedin.com/company/cohere-ai?trk=public_post-text)’s Command R+ model.
So instead of storing just the raw text:
“This approach improved accuracy by 40%”
I now store:
“This approach improved accuracy by 40%” + Context Summary: “Discussion of knowledge graph-based retrieval systems showing performance improvements over traditional vector search in academic benchmarking.”
Now, my vector database doesn’t just retrieve matching words —it retrieves meaning.
⚡Why Cohere Command R+?
After testing multiple LLMs, Command R+ nailed it because:
It follows instructions precisely (critical for consistent contextual summaries)
It’s fast enough for batch-processing hundreds of chunks
It produces concise, high-quality context snapshots
It’s not the cheapest, but the jump in retrieval relevance and precision made it absolutely worth it.
📈The Real Lesson
Raw text chunks are like puzzle pieces without the picture on the box.
Adding context gives your RAG system that picture.
I compared results between:
RAG (without contextual retrieval) ❌RAG (with contextual retrieval) ✅…and the contextual version delivered significantly higher accuracy and semantic relevance across test queries.
🔜Step 3: Building the Knowledge Graph Layer
Next, I’ll be connecting these contextual chunks into structured entities and relationships —the step that turns simple “retrieval” into true understanding.
Have you tried contextual chunking or experimented with RAG enhancement techniques? I’d love to hear what worked for you.

Step 3: From contextual chunks to ontology generation. This is where things get really interesting.
What I realized
Vector search is great for “find similar text.” But it completely misses relationships.
Example:
Vector search: “Einstein” is similar to “physicist” ✓What it misses: Einstein FOUNDED relativity theory →which INFLUENCED quantum mechanics →which LED TO modern physics
Those arrows —those connections —are what make answers intelligent.
The challenge I faced
How do you automatically extract entities and relationships from text without manually defining everything?
I tried rule-based extraction first. Total disaster. Each document type broke it in new ways. Then I realized: why not let an LLM understand the text and extract the structure itself?
Enter: LLM-powered Ontology Generation
I used[Groq](https://www.linkedin.com/company/groq?trk=public_post-text)(openai/gpt-oss-120b) to read my enhanced chunks and extract:
Entities (people, methods, concepts)
Relationships (causes, improves, contradicts, etc.)
Properties (dates, values, categories)
The magic? It’s not rule-based —the LLM understands the context.
However, due to token limits, I later switched to Cohere Command-R+, one of the most advanced NLP models today, to handle larger, more complex document sets.
Why Groq?
Speed. This system analyzes hundreds of chunks in real time. Groq’s LPU hardware makes Llama 3 lightning-fast —subsecond responses.
For 500 chunks:
Regular LLM API: 15–20 mins
Groq: Under 3 mins
What the output looks like
(Knowledge Graph) --ENABLES--&gt;&gt; (Retrieval Systems)
(Retrieval Systems) --ACHIEVES--&gt;&gt; (40% Accuracy Improvement)
(Graph Traversal) --COMPARED\_TO--&gt;&gt; (Vector Search)
Now, when someone asks “What improves retrieval accuracy?”, the system doesn’t just find mentions —it traverses relationships to understand context.
The insight
Text is 1D. Knowledge graphs are multi-dimensional.
You can now search by:
Direct mentions
Relationships
Concept paths
Properties (date, author, domain)
This is what separates basic RAG from intelligent retrieval.
Next: Storing everything in Neo4j and making it queryable —where the real magic begins.
Anyone else working with knowledge graphs? What’s been your biggest challenge?

Step 1: How I Solved the Hidden Bottleneck in My RAG System —Smart Document Parsing 🧠📄When I started building my Agentic Graph RAG system, I assumed the toughest part would be tuning embeddings or optimizing retrieval.
I was wrong.
The real challenge hit me earlier —getting PDFs to talk sense.
What looked like a simple “just extract the text” task turned into a deep dive into the chaos of scattered columns, broken tables, and unreadable scans. That’s when I realized:
Most RAG systems fail long before retrieval —right at the data-ingestion step.
The Problem I Faced
PDFs are a nightmare for AI systems:
Text is scattered across columns
Tables lose their structure
Scanned documents need OCR
Images and charts mixed with text
I tried the usual tools - PyMuPDF, PDFMiner. Each one solved ONE problem but created three more. I was building a Frankenstein pipeline just to read documents.
What Actually Worked
I switched to LlamaParse and it changed everything.
Instead of chaining 5 different tools, I made ONE API call. That's it.
LlamaParse uses LLMs to understand the document like a human would. It handles text, tables, images, and even scanned PDFs automatically.
Here's the difference:
Before: PyMuPDF →PDFMiner →[Unstructured.io](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http://Unstructured.io&amp;urlhash=ZNpn&amp;trk=public_post_reshare-text)→ Tesseract →Custom code to merge everything (fragile mess)
After: LlamaParse API call →Clean, structured text (just works)
Why This Matters
Bad parsing = Bad knowledge extraction = Bad answers
Your fancy LLM and vector database won't save you if the input is garbage.
I learned this the hard way after debugging why my system kept giving weird answers. Turned out, my table parsing was breaking the data structure.
The Real Lesson
Don't overcomplicate the basics. Sometimes paying for a good API beats building a complex system yourself.
My parsing pipeline went from 200 lines of fragile code to 20 lines that actually work.
This is Step 1 of building my Agentic Graph RAG system. Next up: adding contextual summaries to make retrieval smarter.
What's your experience with document parsing? Any horror stories? 😅[LlamaIndex](https://www.linkedin.com/company/llamaindex?trk=public_post_reshare-text)[Jerry Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-liu-64390071?trk=public_post_reshare-text)[#AI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/ai&amp;trk=public_post_reshare-text)[#RAG](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/rag&amp;trk=public_post_reshare-text)[#LLM](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/llm&amp;trk=public_post_reshare-text)[#DocumentAI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/documentai&amp;trk=public_post_reshare-text)P.S. - If you're building something similar, happy to share what I learned.

RAG isn’t a silver bullet. It’s a scalpel.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation shines in document AI—but only in the right jobs. Here’s the decision play we use with enterprise teams:
Use RAG when…
•You need cross-document answers (contracts + emails + policies).
•You’re summarizing narratives or explaining policy impacts.
•You require citations back to source pages for trust.
•The schema is fluid and you care more about reasoning than exact fields.
Don’t use RAG when…
•You need deterministic, field-level accuracy (KYC, claims, compliance forms).
•Outputs must match a strict schema or trigger downstream automations.
•Millisecond latency or ultra-low cost is the priority.
Best-practice guardrails
•Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vectors), section-aware chunking, versioned indexes.
•Validator layer: JSON schema + rule checks before anything hits your systems.
•Governance: citation required, PII masking, cost caps, human-in-the-loop.
Result: fewer hallucinations, faster reviews, and a stack that scales with confidence.

🕸️Can LLMs Really Build Knowledge Graphs We Can Trust?
There’s a growing trend: “Let’s use LLMs to build knowledge graphs.”
It sounds like the perfect shortcut - take unstructured data, prompt an LLM, and get a ready-to-use graph.
But… are we sure those graphs are trustworthy?
Before that, let’s pause for a second:
💡Why build knowledge graphs at all?
Because they solve one of AI’s biggest weaknesses - lack of structure and reasoning. Graphs let us connect facts, entities, and relationships in a way that’s transparent, queryable, and explainable. They give context, memory, and logic - everything that raw text or embeddings alone can’t provide.
Yet, here’s the catch when using LLMs to build them:
🔹Short context window - LLMs can only “see” a limited amount of data at once, losing consistency across larger corpora.
🔹Hallucinations - when context runs out or ambiguity appears, models confidently invent facts or relations that never existed.
🔹Lack of provenance - LLM outputs don’t preserve why or how a link was made. Without traceability, you can’t audit or explain your graph.
🔹Temporal instability - the same prompt can yield different graphs tomorrow, because stochastic generation ≠deterministic structure.
🔹Scalability &amp; cost - large-scale graph construction requires persistent context and reasoning, which LLMs weren’t designed for.
Building knowledge graphs isn’t just data extraction - it’s engineering meaning. It demands consistency, provenance, and explainability, not just text generation.
LLMs can assist in this process, but they shouldn’t be the architect.
The next step is finding a way to make graphs both trustworthy and instant - without compromising one for the other.

The idea is that LLM produces a draft of a graph and then an experienced LLM ontologist curates it, covering key gaps that LLM lacks knowledge of (e.g. corporate lingo, private structures) and key business assumptions.

“Why build knowledge graphs at all?
Because they solve one of AI’s biggest weaknesses - lack of structure and reasoning. Graphs let us connect facts, entities, and relationships in a way that’s transparent, queryable, and explainable. 🚨They give context, memory, and logic - everything that raw text or embeddings alone can’t provide.”

🕸️Can LLMs Really Build Knowledge Graphs We Can Trust?
There’s a growing trend: “Let’s use LLMs to build knowledge graphs.”
It sounds like the perfect shortcut - take unstructured data, prompt an LLM, and get a ready-to-use graph.
But… are we sure those graphs are trustworthy?
Before that, let’s pause for a second:
💡Why build knowledge graphs at all?
Because they solve one of AI’s biggest weaknesses - lack of structure and reasoning. Graphs let us connect facts, entities, and relationships in a way that’s transparent, queryable, and explainable. They give context, memory, and logic - everything that raw text or embeddings alone can’t provide.
Yet, here’s the catch when using LLMs to build them:
🔹Short context window - LLMs can only “see” a limited amount of data at once, losing consistency across larger corpora.
🔹Hallucinations - when context runs out or ambiguity appears, models confidently invent facts or relations that never existed.
🔹Lack of provenance - LLM outputs don’t preserve why or how a link was made. Without traceability, you can’t audit or explain your graph.
🔹Temporal instability - the same prompt can yield different graphs tomorrow, because stochastic generation ≠deterministic structure.
🔹Scalability &amp; cost - large-scale graph construction requires persistent context and reasoning, which LLMs weren’t designed for.
Building knowledge graphs isn’t just data extraction - it’s engineering meaning. It demands consistency, provenance, and explainability, not just text generation.
LLMs can assist in this process, but they shouldn’t be the architect.
The next step is finding a way to make graphs both trustworthy and instant - without compromising one for the other.
