## Summary

LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on **agents**.

The page mentions several components and concepts relevant to your query:

*   **Agent Frameworks:** LangChain itself is an agent framework. It also mentions **LangGraph** as a low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime built upon which LangChain agents operate.
*   **Tool Use/Function Calling:** LangChain includes **Tools** as a core component, which enables agents to interact with external functions (similar to function calling).
*   **Agent Memory:** It lists **Short-term memory** and **Long-term memory** under advanced usage.
*   **Structured Outputs:** **Structured output** is listed as a core component.
*   **Agent Orchestration:** This is handled by LangChain and, for advanced needs, by **LangGraph**.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** This is listed under advanced usage, allowing programmatic connection to documentation via services like Claude and VSCode for real-time answers.
*   **SDKs/Integrations:** LangChain provides integrations to connect to **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Google** models.

**Missing/Not Explicitly Detailed:** The page does not explicitly detail "agentic memory" (though it covers memory generally), "OpenAI Agents SDK," "Anthropic Agents SDK," or "Google SDK" as separate entities, only that LangChain integrates with the underlying providers.

LangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs. With under 10 lines of code, you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and[more](https://python.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview). LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.We recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous applications. Use[LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview), our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.LangChain[agents](https://python.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/agents)are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.## [​

## Standard model interface
Different providers have unique APIs for interacting with models, including the format of responses. LangChain standardizes how you interact with models so that you can seamlessly swap providers and avoid lock-in.

## Easy to use, highly flexible agent
LangChain’s agent abstraction is designed to be easy to get started with, letting you build a simple agent in under 10 lines of code. But it also provides enough flexibility to allow you to do all the context engineering your heart desires.

## Built on top of LangGraph
LangChain’s agents are built on top of LangGraph. This allows us to take advantage of LangGraph’s durable execution, human-in-the-loop support, persistence, and more.
